BLACK CONTINUES... ELVISH SINGING....A WOMAN'S VOICE IS
whispering, tinged with SADNESS and REGRET:

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
              (Elvish: subtitled)
          "I amar prestar sen: han mathon ne nen,
          han mathon ne chae...a han noston ned
          wilith."
              (English:)
          The world is changed: I feel it in the
          water, I feel it in the earth, I smell it
          in the air...Much that once was is lost,
          for none now live who remember it.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
          It began with the forging of the Great
          Rings.

IMAGE: THREE RINGS, each set with a single GEM, are received
by the HIGH ELVES-GALADRIEL, GIL-GALAD and CIRDAN.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Three were given to the Elves, immortal,
          wisest...fairest of all beings.

IMAGE: SEVEN RINGS held aloft in triumph by the DWARF LORDS.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Seven to the Dwarf Lords, great miners
          and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

IMAGE: NINE RINGS clutched tightly by the KINGS OF MEN...as
if holding-close a precious secret.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And Nine...nine rings were gifted to the
          race of Men who, above all else, desire
          power.

          For within these rings was bound the
          strength and will to govern each race.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But they were all of them deceived.

FADE UP: An ancient PARCHMENT MAP of MIDDLE EARTH...moving
slowly across the MAP as if drawn by an unseen force the
CAMERA closes in on a PLACE NAME...MORDOR.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...for another ring was made.

TEASING SHOTS: SAURON forging the ONE RING in the CHAMBERS of
SAMMATH NAUR.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          In the land of Mordor, in the fires of
          Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged
          in secret a Master Ring to control all
          others.

emerges on the plain BAND OF GOLD.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...and into this Ring he poured his
          cruelty, his malice and his will to
          dominate all life.

IMAGE: THE ONE RING falls through SPACE and into flames...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          One Ring to rule them all...

around the realm of GONDOR...

from their homes, pursued by ARMIES OF HIDEOUS ORCS.

                    GALADRIEL
          One by one the Free lands of Middle earth
          fell to the power of the ring.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But there were some...who resisted.

FADE UP: ISILDUR, son of the KING OF GONDOR, leads an ARMY
ACROSS the PLAINS OF DAGORLAD...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          A last alliance of Men and Elves marched
          against the armies of Mordor.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          On the slopes of Mount Doom they fought
          for the freedom of Middle- Earth.

TEASING SHOTS: THE BATTLE OF DAGORLAD...THE ELF LORD, ELROND,

commands rank after rank of ELVEN ARCHERS...ORCS RETREATING
before the ARMY of the LAST ALLIANCE...ELENDIL holds aloft
the great sword....NARSIL!

                    GALADRIEL
          Victory was near!

IMAGES: THE HUGE, DARK FIGURE OF SARURON, bearing the ONE
RING on his finger, looms over the field of battle...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But the power of the Ring could not be
          undone.

IMAGE: SAURON lays waste to the armies of the LAST ALLIANCE.
With desperate courage, ELENDIL leads a charge...THE BLACK
MACE OF SAURON LASHES OUT!! IMAGE: ELENDIL'S body falls like
a crumpled rag doll... IMAGE: ISILDUR cradles the body of his
father in his arms. The SHADOW OF SAURON falls over him...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It was in this moment..when all hope had
          faded, that Isildur, son of the king,
          took up his father's sword.

ISILDUR snatches up the BROKEN BLADE OF NARSIL..The BLADE
severs SAURON'S FINGERS... AND THE ONE RING FLIES from his
body.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of
          Middle Earth, was defeated. SAURON'S
          ARMOR clatters to the ground. His body

GONE....VAPORIZED! CLOSE ON: ISILDUR picks up the SEVERED
FINGER and removes the ONE RING...transfixed!

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          The Ring passed to Isildur...who had this
          one chance to destroy evil forever.

IMAGE: GLADDEN FIELD...ISILDUR leads a small column of men
through DARKENING WOODS...the ONE RING glinting on a CHAIN
around his neck.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            But the hearts of Men are easily
            corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a
            will of its own.

SUDDENLY!    ARROWS FLY!   They are ambushed by ORCS...ISILDUR
SCREAMS!

                                                     FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP: ISILDUR MATERIALIZES UNDER WATER...as THE RING slips
slowly from his finger. Ripples of LIGHT play across
ISILDUR'S PALE FACE...he is DEAD.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            It betrayed Isildur to his death.

IMAGE: THE RING falls through the MURKY WATERS of the RIVER
ANDUIN.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            And some things that should not have been
            forgotten...were lost.

                                                     FADE TO BLACK

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            History became legend...legend became
            myth.

FADE UP: The waters of the ANDUIN RIVER lie dark and
undisturbed.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            And for two and a half thousand years the
            Ring passed out of all knowledge.

IMAGE: SILT SWIRLS...A THIN WHITE HAND reaches
down...grasping the RING...

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            Until, when chance came, it ensnared a
            new bearer!

IMAGE: THE THIN WHITE HAND opens to reveal one ring.

                      GOLLUM (V.O.)
            My Precious...

                                                                5.



IMAGE: MIST SHROUDED MOUNTAINS...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
          The Ring came to the creature Gollum, who
          took it deep into the tunnels of the
          Misty Mountains.

IMAGE: THE GLOOM of a MOUNTAIN CAVERN..a MURKY POOL of
WATER...in the DARKNESS the SHADOWY OUTLINE of an EMACIATED
FIGURE.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And there, it consumed him. A RASPY VOICE
          mutters in the half light...

                    GOLLUM
          It came to me. My own.     My love...
              (ecstatic whisper)
          My preciousness.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
          The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long
          life. For five hundred years it poisoned
          his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's
          cave...

                                                     FADE TO BLACK

                       GALADRIEL (V.O.)   (CONT'D)
          It waited.

FADE UP: Bathed in COLD MOONLIGHT, the WORLD lies DARK and
STILL...the unsettled quiet before the storm...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Darkness crept back into the forests of
          the world. Rumor grew of a Shadow in the
          East...whispers of a nameless fear. And
          the Ring of Power perceived...its time
          had now come. It abandoned Gollum.

SLOW MOTION: unseen by its KEEPER..THE RING falls to the
MUDDY FLOOR of a MOUNTAIN TUNNEL...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But something happened then the Ring did
          not intend...

RING.

                      GALADRIEL
            It was picked up by the most unlikely
            creature imaginable...

                      BILBO
                (to himself)
            What's this?

A YOUNGISH LOOKING BILBO BAGGINS peers down at what lies in
his hand...PERPLEXED by what he has found.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.)
            A Hobbit....Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

                      BILBO
                (surprised)
            A Ring.

SUDDENLY!   A VOICE SCREAMS...ITS ANGUISH RINGING through the

COLD, DANK TUNNELS...

                       GOLLUM (V.O.)
            Lost!   Lost! My Precious is lost!!

Frightened Bilbo quickly POCKETS the ONE RING and hurries on.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

WIDE ON: THE CAMERA SOARS AWAY FROM THE MOUNTAINS.      MOVING

FASTER AND FASTER...THEIR DARK GREEN FORESTS AND JAGGED

WHITE PEAKS RECEDING INTO THE SHROUD OF MIST

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.)
            For the time will soon come when Hobbits
            will shape the fortunes of all.

GRASSES SUPER: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING SUPER: THE
SHIRE....60 YEARS LATER CAMERA TRACKS TO: a Figure lies

CONTINUED:

White flowers are scattered among the Well seeded grasses.
An idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer... the
figure is reading a book. ON THE SOUNDTRACK: In the distance,
growing louder..over the Gentle clip clop of an approaching
cart and horse can be heard the HUMMING OF A DEEP VOICE to
the tune of "The Road Goes Ever On and On..."

SUDDENLY! The figure in the grass sits up...looking straight
at camera is a handsome young HOBBIT, with dark curly hair
and deep blue eyes. This is FRODO BAGGINS...his EYES alight
with EXCITEMENT! Tossing away the long stem of grass in his
mouth, Frodo runs off.

                                                         CUT TO:

EXT. SHIRE LANE -- DAY

The cart rattles along a leafy lane, driven by a stooped
figure in Grey.

INTERCUT WITH; SHOTS OF FRODO RUNNING... CAREERING DOWN A

HILL. . .JUMPING OVER LOGS... DODGING TREE BRANCHES.

                                                       ANGLE ON:

The shambling OLD PONY snorts and rears as... SUDDENLY FRODO
appears on a bank above the cart.

                    FRODO
          You're late.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF glowers at the young Hobbit...

                    GANDALF
          A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins,
          nor is he early. He arrives precisely
          when he means to.

They look at each other a moment..then both start laughing as
FRODO'S face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front
seat of the cart.

                    FRODO
          It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

Next to Gandalf, we see how small Hobbits are...Frodo is 3
foot 6 inches tall.

                    GANDALF
          You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle
          Bilbo's birthday?

                                                         CUT TO:

EXT. HOBBITON FIELDS -- DAY

Wide on: The cart rattles past a FIELD LUPIN being tended by

HOBBITS.

                     FRODO
           What news of the outside world? Tell me
           everything!

                                                       ANGLE ON:

Gandalf looks down at Frodo, a twinkle in his eye.

                     GANDALF
           What, everything? Far too eager and
           curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural...

Wide on: The cart rattles over a Stone bridge towards a Busy
Hobbit Marketplace.

                      GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Well, what can I tell you? Life in the
           wide world goes on much as if it has past
           age. Full of its own comings and goings,
           scarcely even aware of the existence of
           Hobbits...

Close on: Gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before
him.

                     GANDALF (CONT'D)
           ...for which I am very thankful.

                                                       ANGLE ON:

Hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the
cart bearing Gandalf and Frodo rolls past the Green Dragon
Inn...towards... Wide on: The party field. Where scOrcs of
Hobbits are busy preparing for the big night.

                     GANDALF (CONT'D)
           Ah, the long expected party. So, how is
           the old rascal? I hear it's going to be
           a Party of Special Magnificence.

                     FRODO
           You know Bilbo...he's got he whole place
           in an uproar.

                     GANDALF
           Oh, well...that should please him.

                    FRODO
          Half the Shire's been invited...

                    GANDALF
          Good gracious, me.

                    FRODO
          He's up to something.

                    GANDALF
          Oh, really?

Frodo shoots a knowing look, as Gandalf averts his eyes.

                    FRODO
          Alright then..keep your secrets. Before
          you came along we Bagginses were very
          well thought of.

                       GANDALF
          Indeed?

                    FRODO
          Never had any adventures or did anything
          unexpected.

                    GANDALF
          If you're referring to the incident with
          the Dragon...I was barely involved...all
          I did was give your Uncle a little nudge
          out the door.

                    FRODO
          Whatever you did...you've been officially
          labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.

                    GANDALF
          Oh, really?

                                                       ANGLE ON:

ODO PROUDFOOT looks up as the Cart passes by, deeply
suspicious.

As the cart rattles into the small village of Hobbiton...a
quaint rustic settlement, nestled amongst rolling green hills
and large trees.

The Hobbits live in Hobbit Holes: neat burrows dug into the
grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens.

                                                     ANGLE ON:

Excited children, chasing after the cart.

                                                     CLOSE ON:

Gandalf ignOrcs the children's cries. The children stand
deflated, watching Gandalf disappear up the lane. At that
moment: spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of
the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children.

                                                     ANGLE ON:

Gandalf smiling to himself, well pleased with his joke. ODO
PROUDFOOT is unable to suppress a chuckle. Frodo stands up in
the cart as Gandalf reigns in the horse.

                    FRODO
          Gandalf... I'm glad you're back. Frodo
          leaps expertly from the cart. Gandalf
          smiles.

                    GANDALF
          So am I, dear boy...so am I

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. BAG END -- DAY

Wide on: GANDALF'S CART pulls up outside the gate to BAG
END...a particularly fine example of a Hobbit hole, with a
large round front door set into a grassy hillside. There is
a sign on the gate which reads: "NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON
PARTY BUSINESS." Gandalf strides up to the garden path of Bag
End. He raises his staff and raps on the front door...a
voice calls out:

                     BILBO (O.S.)
          No, thank you! We don't want any more
          visitors, well wishers, or distant
          relations.

                    GANDALF
          And what about very old friends?

Suddenly the door opens and BILBO BAGGINS stands before him.
He is a HOBBIT OF INDERTIMINATE AGE, with a mischievous
Twinkle in his eye. Wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he
looks every inch the eccentric gentleman.

                     BILBO
          Gandalf?

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo Baggins!

                    BILBO
          My dear Gandalf!

Gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend.

                    GANDALF
          It's good to see you. One hundred and
          eleven years old, who would believe it!

Gandalf looks at him more keenly.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          You haven't aged a day! Gandalf and Bilbo
          laugh together and enter Bag End.

                    BILBO
          Come on, come in!   Welcome, welcome!!

                                                        CUT TO:

INT. BAG END LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Bilbo leads Gandalf into Bag End...cozy and cluttered with
souvenirs of Bilbo's travels. Gandalf has to stoop to avoid
hitting his head on the low ceiling. Bilbo hangs up Gandalf's
hat on a peg and trots off down the hall.

                    BILBO
              (Calling)
          Tea? Or maybe something stronger... I've
          a few bottles of the Old Winyard left,
          1296...a very good year, almost as old as
          I am. It was laid down by my father. What
          say we open one, eh?

Bilbo disappears into the kitchen as Gandalf looks
around..enjoying the familiarity of Bag End...he turns,
knocking his head on the light and then walking into the
wooden beam. He groans.

                    BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I was expecting you some time last week.
          Not that it matters, you come and go as
          you please, always have done, always
          will.

                    BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          You've caught me a bit unprepared, I'm
          afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit
          of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no,
          that might be a little risky...

Gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one
corner...it is Thorin's map of the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf
smiles to himself.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple
          tart...got some custard somewhere. Not
          much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh
          no...we're alright...I've just found some
          sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope
          it's enough.
              (comes into view)
          I could do you some eggs if you like?

Bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as Gandalf
mysteriously appears behind him.

                    GANDALF
          Just tea, thank you.

                       BILBO
          Oh..right.     You don't mind if...?

                    GANDALF
          No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud
          knock on the front door.

MRS. SACKVILLE BAGGINS (O.S.)

Bilbo Baggins, you open this door..I know you're in there.

                    BILBO
          I'm not home.

Gandalf watches, amused as Bilbo tries to hide.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I've got to get away from these
          confounded relatives, hanging on the bell
          all day, never giving me a moment's
          peace. I want to see mountains
          again...mountains, Gandalf... and then
          find somewhere quiet where I can finish
          my book...Oh, Tea!

                    GANDALF
          So, you mean to go through with your
          plan, then?

                    BILBO
          Yes, yes...it's all inhand.   All the
          arrangements are made.

                    GANDALF
          Frodo suspects something.

                    BILBO
          'Course he does, he's a Baggins...not
          some block headed Bracegirdle from
          Hardbottle!

                    GANDALF
          You will tell him, won't you?

                      BILBO
          Yes, yes.

                    GANDALF
          He's very fond of you.

                    BILBO
          I know. He'd probably come with me if I
          asked him. I think, in his heart,
          Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the
          woods and the fields... little rivers.
          Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen
          window.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I am old, Gandalf... Bilbo looks at
          Gandalf sadly...

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning
          to feel it in my heart.

                                                      CLOSE ON:

Bilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket...gripping
a small, unseen object.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I feel thin...sort of stretched, like
          butter scraped over too much bread. I
          need a holiday...a very long holiday and
          I don't expect I shall return...in fact,
          I mean not to.

INT. BAG END -- EVENING

Gandalf and Bilbo are sitting on the Bag End porch. Below
them, final preparations are being made on the Party field.
Bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe.

                    BILBO
          Old Toby, the finest weed in
          Southfarthing!

Bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the
air. A tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through
the Center of Bilbo's smoke ring.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Ohhhh,
              (smiles)
          Gandalf my old friend...this will be a
          night to remember!

                                                      CUT TO:

EXT. PARTY FIELD, HOBBITON -- NIGHT

BOOM! A FIREWORK explodes into the night sky high above
Hobbiton...in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding
branches. TILT DOWN: with glowing flowers as they rain down
from the branches...evaporating just above the up turned
faces of the delighted party-goers 144 Hobbits, feasting and
drinking Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the
tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories.
Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark
that dances magically from his staff... Bilbo is greeting
visitors. Frodo and SAM sit at a table drinking ale...Frodo
notices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit,
Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away.

                    FRODO
          Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.

                     SAM
               (horrified)
          I think I'll just have myself another
          ale.

                    FRODO
          Oh, no you don't. Go on.

Sam goes to drain his glass... suddenly it is snatched out of
his hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing
throng of dancers.

                                                            15.



ANGLE ON: SAM'S HORRIFIED FACE

as he is Swept away.   Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Gandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework
that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests.

Close on: Bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a
group of young hobbit children.

                    BILBO
              (melodramatic)
          So, there I was...at the mercy of three
          monstrous trolls...Have you ever heard of
          a troll? Do you know what a Troll is?
          Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly
          things..and they're arguing...arguing
          about how they were going to cook us!

ANGLE ON: A LITTLE HOBBIT GIRL'S

upturned face...her eyes growing larger and larger.

                    BILBO
          Whether it be turned on a spit or minced
          in a pie or whether they were going to
          sit on us one by one and squash us into
          jelly! But they spent so long arguing
          the whether-to's and why-for's that the
          sun's first light crept over the top of
          the trees...and turned them all to stone!

STUNNED GASPS from his young Audience greet his astonishing
feat! Close on: MERRY AND PIPPIN, two mischievous Young
Hobbits in their late teens. Pippin scrambles on to the back
of Gandalf's wagon, snatching up a small firework

                    MERRY
              (urgent whisper)
          No, no..the big one...the big one! Pippin
          grabs a huge rocket. CLOSE ON: FIREWORK
          FUSE crackles with flame!

Merry is holding out the big rocket...he looks aghast at the
fizzing fuse that Pippin has just lit.

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
              (worried whisper)
          You're supposed to stick it in the
          ground!


                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           16.
CONTINUED:


                    PIPPIN
          It is in the ground.

Merry fearfully tosses the Rocket to Pippin!    The fuse
sizzles angrily.

                     MERRY
          Outside!

                    PIPPIN
          It was your idea.

Pippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to Merry.
WHOOSH! The two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in
a shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening
power. The ROCKET ZOOMS over the Party..It suddenly bursts
apart, forming the shape of a great red golden Dragon! Fire
gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and Flies low
towards the startled crowd. Close on: Frodo watches the
Fireworks Dragon with alarm...but Bilbo is oblivious to the
Panicking crowd and impending danger!

                     FRODO
          Bilbo!   Watch out for the dragon!!

                    BILBO
          Dragon? Nonsense...hasn1t been a dragon
          in these parts for a thousand years!

ANGLE ON: FRODO

As he hurriedly pulls Bilbo to the ground, just as the dragon
roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express
train! Hobbits dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents
collapse, food flies everywhere. The fireworks dragon turns a
somersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang!
This gets the biggest Cheer of the night.

ANGLE ON: MERRY AND PIPPIN,

clothes and hair smoking.

                    MERRY
          That was good!

                    PIPPIN
          Let's get another one!

LARGE HANDS suddenly clamp down on Merry and Pippin's ears.
Low angle: Gandalf looking DOWN STERNLY!

MERRY AND PIPPIN

Are leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy
water...with Gandalf sitting nearby, smoking his pipe and
sipping an ale. Cries of "SPEECH! SPEECH" erupt from the
party.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Bilbo stepping on a stool...he bows in gratitude at the
applause.

                       FRODO
          Speech!

                    BILBO
              (clearing throat)
          My dear Bagginses, and Boffins, tooks and
          Brandybucks...Grubbs, Chubbs,
          Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and
          Proudfoots...

ANGLE ON: A HOBBIT WITH PARTICULARLY BIG FEET

                       ODO PROUDFOOT
          Proudfeet!

                    BILBO
          Today is my one hundred and eleventh
          birthday. Yes, and alas...Eleventy- one
          years is far too short a time to live
          among such excellent and admirable
          Hobbits! Tremendous outburst of approval!

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I don't know half of you half as well as
          I should like; and I like less than half
          of you as well as well as you deserve.

SCATTERED CLAPPING as the guests try to work out if that was
a compliment or not. CLOSE ON: FRODO AND GANDALF smiling to
themselves. CLOSE ON: Bilbo...a strange hum seems to fill his
head. A bead of sweat rolls down his brow.

Bilbo's hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and
holds it behind his back.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

          I have..things to do and I have put this
          off for far too long... CLOSE ON: BILBO'S
          knuckles turn white as he tightens his
          grip on the small object behind his back.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I regret to announce, this is the end. I
          am going now. I bid you all a very fond
          farewell!! Bilbo looks across at Frodo,
          hesitates... then...

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (whisper)
          Goodbye.

Bilbo instantly vanishes. The party explodes into an
uproar... the crowd leaps to its feet.

ANGLE ON: FRODO

staring at the empty stool in disbelief.

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. BAG END -- NIGHT

The party is still in an excited uproar... some 50 yards away
as we pan across a moonlit lane to the front door of Bag End.
Door opens, pulled by an invisible hand.

INT. BAG END -- NIGHT

The door quietly closes...Bilbo materializes as he pulls a
plain gold ring off his finger. Bilbo laughs as he tosses the
ring in the air, then places it in his pocket.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Bilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick. He
finds Gandalf looming over him.

                    GANDALF
          I suppose you think that was terribly
          clever?

                    BILBO
          Come on, Gandalf!   Did you see their
          faces?




                                                  (CONTINUED)

                    GANDALF
          There are many magic rings in the world,
          Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be
          used lightly.

                    BILBO
          It was just a bit of fun.   Oh, you're
          probably right as usual.

                    GANDALF
          You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?

                    BILBO
          I'm leaving everything to him.

                    GANDALF
          What about this ring of yours?   Is that
          staying too?

Close on: Bilbo...he gives Gandalf a look and nods toward the
mantelpiece.

                    BILBO
          Yes, yes, it's in an envelope...over
          there on the mantelpiece. Gandalf frowns
          at the empty mantelpiece...Bilbo suddenly
          feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty
          surprise.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          No, wait. It's here in my pocket. Isn't
          that...isn't' that odd now? Yet, after
          all, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?

                    GANDALF
          I think you should leave the Ring behind,
          Bilbo. Is that so hard?

                    BILBO
          Well, no...and yes. Now it comes to it,
          I don't feel like parting with it. It's
          mine. I found it. It came to me!

ANGLE ON: GANDALF LOOKS DOWN AT BILBO WITH RISING CONCERN.

                    GANDALF
          There's no need to get angry.

                    BILBO
          Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's
          mine. My own, my precious.

                    GANDALF
          Precious? It's been called that before,
          but not by you.

                    BILBO
          So? What business is it of yours what I
          do with my own things? Bilbo's voice,
          shape and manner have suddenly changed.

                    GANDALF
          I think you've had that ring quite long
          enough.

                    BILBO
          You want it for yourself!

Gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow
suddenly seems to fill the room

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some
          conjurer of cheap tricks! Bilbo cowers
          from Gandalf, disarmed by his power...a
          frightened Hobbit. Gandalf's expression
          softens.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          I am not trying to rob you. I am trying
          to help you. Sobbing, Bilbo runs to
          Gandalf and hugs him.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          All you long years we've been
          friends...trust me as you once did. Let
          it go!

                    BILBO
          You're right, Gandalf...the ring must go
          to Frodo.

Bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          It's late, the road is long... yes, it is
          time.

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo?

                    BILBO
          Hmmm?

          The ring is still in your pocket.

Bilbo hesitates...reaches into his pocket.

                     BILBO
          Oh, yes.

CLOSE ON: Bilbo pulls out the ring...he stares at it in his
palm. With all his will power, Bilbo allows the ring to
slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor. CLOSE ON:
The tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor.

EXT. BAG END -- NIGHT

Bilbo staggering out of Bag end...he braces himself in the
night air, Pale and Trembling, as if his loss of the ring has
weakened him. Gandalf steps up behind.

                    BILBO
          I've thought up and ending for my
          book..."And he lived happily ever after
          to the end of his days."

                    GANDALF
          I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

                    BILBO
          Goodbye, Gandalf.

                    GANDALF
          Goodbye Bilbo.

Bilbo walks away from Bag End, disappearing into the night,
softly singing: "The Road goes on and on."

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
              (softly)
          Until our next meeting.

INT. BAG END LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

CLOSE ON: THE RING...Glinting on the floor...Gandalf circles
around it, a Puzzled look on his face. Gandalf slowly reaches
for the ring. His fingers barely touch the ring...the creepy
Hum rises on the soundtrack. Gandalf is sitting in front of
the fire, with his pipe...staring into the flickering flames.

          Bilbo! Bilbo!

Frodo rushes into Bag End...he stops and picks up the ring at
his feet. Gandalf continues staring into the fire, as if
locked in thought.

                    GANDALF
              (to himself)
          My precious...precious..

                    FRODO
              (quietly)
          He's gone, hasn't he? Frodo steps into
          the living room.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          He talked for so long about leaving...I
          didn't think he'd really do it.

                     GANDALF
              (mutters to himself)
          ...my own.

                     FRODO
          Gandalf?

Gandalf turns...his eyes locking onto the ring in Frodo's
fingers.

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo's ring.

Gandalf sorts hurriedly through Bilbo's papers...

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          He's gone to stay with the Elves. He's
          left you Bag End...

Gandalf holds out the envelope...Frodo drops the ring into
it.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          ...along with all his possessions.

Gandolf seals the envelope with wax.   He hands it to Frodo.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          The ring is yours now. But it somewhere
          out of sight. Gandalf rises hurriedly and
          starts to gather his things.

                    FRODO
          Where are you going?

                    GANDALF
          I have some things I must see to.

                    FRODO
          What things?

                       GANDALF
          Questions.     Questions that need
          answering.

                    FRODO
          You've only just arrived!    I don't
          understand...

Gandalf is already at the door, he turns to Frodo.

                    GANDALF
          Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it
          safe.

Gandalf hurries out the door...leaving FRODO standing alone
in the Bag End.

ANGLE ON: THE ENVELOPE

ring...beneath the hum the whispered murmur of BLACK SPEECH

          Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has

                    GANDALF
          No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron has
          endured. His life force is bound to the
          ring and the ring survived. Sauron has
          returned. His Orcs have multiplied...his
          fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the
          land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this
          ring to cover all the lands in the second
          darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it,
          all his thought is bent on it. For the
          ring yearns, above all else, to return to
          the hand of its master: they are one, the
          ring and the dark lord. Frodo, he must
          never find out. SUDDENLY Frodo scoops up

            My dear Frodo, Hobbits really are amazing
            creatures. You can learn all that there
            is to know about their ways in a month,
            and yet, after a hundred years, they can
            still surprise you.

          You know this? How?

                    SARUMAN

plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth...

          wise abandon reason for madness?

At that moment: Gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room!
He slams against the wall...pinned there by some unseen
force. With sudden effort, Gandalf wrenches himself off the
wall and swings his staff on Saruman...blasting him off his
feet! Gandalf and Saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing

Gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp...it
flies across the chamber into Saruman's hand! Gandalf is

EXT. FARMER'S FIELDS -- DAY

Wide on: Frodo and Sam walking along a country lane which
borders Farmer Maggot's Fields. Sam is looking up...Frodo has
disappeared around a corner in the lane.

                     SAM
               (panicked)
          Mr. Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo turns,
          surprised as Sam comes running towards
          him.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
              (worried)
          I thought I lost you. Frodo looks at Sam
          suspiciously. Sam glances down,
          embarrassed.

                    FRODO
              (teasing)
          What are you talking about?

                    SAM
              (mumbling)
          It's just something Gandalf said...

                    FRODO
          What did he say?

                    SAM
          He said..."Don't you leave him, Samwise
          Gamgee."
              (looks at Frodo intently)
          And I don't mean to.

                    FRODO
              (laughing)
          Sam...we're still in the Shire...what
          could possibly happen?

SUDDENLY! A figure comes crashing out of a hedgerow sending
Frodo flying. Frodo picks himself up, only to be knocked back
down again by Pippin.

                     PIPPIN
          Frodo!   Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.

                    MERRY
          Hello Frodo

Merry, Pippin, and Frodo picking themselves up... a variety
of vegetables have scattered everywhere.

                    SAM
          What's the meaning of this!

                    MERRY
          Sam, hold this...

Merry gives Sam a large cabbage.

                    SAM
              (accusing)
          You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

A large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them along the
Hedgerow...angry shouts from Farmer Maggot.

                    FARMER MAGGOT    (O.S.)
          Who's that in my field!     Get out of it!
          Get out of my field, you    young varmits!
          I'll show you...get out    of my corn.

Merry and Pippin hurriedly gather their booty and race
away...with Frodo and Sam on their heels.

                    MERRY
              (looking behind him)
          I don't know why he's so upset, it's only
          a couple of carrots.

                    PIPPIN
          And some cabbages...and those three bags
          of potatoes that we lifted last week.
          And then the mushrooms the week before.

                    MERRY
          Yes, Pippin, my point is, he's clearly
          over reacting.

The BAYING OF LARGE DOGS sounds!

EXT. WOODED ROAD -- DAY

Frodo, Sam, and Merry and Pippin tumble head over heels down
a bank, onto a dark, wooded road. CLOSE ON: A winded Pippin,
his face inches away from a large pile of Horse droppings...

                    PIPPIN
          That was close.

Frodo picks himself up and looks around quickly.

                    MERRY
              (groaning)
          Ow...I think I've broken something.

Pulls a LARGE CARROT, almost broken through in the middle,
out from his back pocket.

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
          Oh.

                    SAM
              (turning on Merry and Pippin)
          Trust a Brandybuck and a Took.

                    MERRY
          What? That was just a detour...a
          shortcut.

                    SAM
          A shortcut to what?

Pippin has spied something under the trees on the far side of
the road.

                     PIPPIN
              (excited)
          Mushrooms!

CLOSE ON: SMALL, brown mushrooms growing amongst the Loamy
undergrowth. Sam, Merry, and Pippin race toward the
mushrooms! Frodo is tense and watchful. He realizes they are
on a wooded road. Scattered leaves rise into the air Whirling
down the road as if blown by an invisible wind...

                                                             41.



SUDDENLY... THE SOUND OF HORSES HOOVES...

                      FRODO
            I think we should get off the road.

A long drawn WAIL comes down the wind, like the cry of some
evil and lonely creature.

                      FRODO (CONT'D)
                (more urgency)
            Get off the road!

Sam grabs Merry and Pippin as the Hobbits quickly scramble
down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. THE SOUND OF HOOVES
is close... A sinister MOUNTED RINGWRATH steps into
view...hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black
horse with insane eyes ! Frodo freezes in terror. The
RINGWRAITH pauses right beside their hiding place...he sits
very still with his head bowed, listening. From inside the
hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an
elusive scent; his head turning from side to side.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

Beads of sweat gather on his brow. The ringwraith suddenly
slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log, peering
suspiciously into the woods.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

He is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling
hands...his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of
some terrible INTERNAL STRUGGLE. The SOUND OF SNIFFING
intensifies as the ringwraith darts his head from side to
side like a bird of party.

CLOSE ON: FRODO SQUEEZING HIS EYES SHUT...

QUICK PSYCHIC BLASTS!   AND EVIL DARK TOWER...A GREAT EYE...A

BURST OF FLAME.

ANGLE ON:   SAM LOOKING AT FRODO WITH CONCERN

                      SAM
            Frodo?

Merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road...the
ringwraith spins around at the sound, and darts to the far
side of the road with frightening speed. Frodo instantly
slumps...as if a PSYCHIC LINK had been broken

                    MERRY
          What was that?

Frodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring
lying in the palm of his hand.

EXT. FERRY LANE -- NIGHT

Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin hurry through the
trees...slipping and sliding on the muddy ground.

                      SAM
          Anything?

                      FRODO
          Nothing.

                    PIPPIN
          What is going on?

Merry moves past pippin, toward Frodo, watching
intently...Sam keeps looking around nervously.

                    MERRY
          The Black rider was looking for
          something...or someone...Frodo?

                      SAM
          Get down!

The SILHOUETTE OF A BLACK RIDER looms against the skyline.
The Four Hobbits... sprawled on the ground, holding their
breath. The BLACK RIDER turns and departs.

                    FRODO
          I have to leave the Shire...Sam and I
          must get to Bree.

Merry looks at his friend...realizing Frodo is in deep
trouble.

                    MERRY
          Right...Buckleberry Ferry...follow me !

The Hobbits break cover. SUDDENLY, A RINGWRAITH bursts out of
the forest TOWARD THEM!

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
          There's another one!! Frodo, this way! !

The Hobbits run   THE RINGWRAITH SHRIEKS!

FRODO, SAM, MERRY AND PIPPIN, are running towards the wide,
placid Brandywine river...and the FERRY.

          Get the ropes, Sam.

QUICK ANGLES: STOMPING HOOVES...SNARLING HORSES...

Four RINGWRAITHS are speeding through the Fog...converging on
the FERRY CROSSING. The HOBBITS stampede across the Wharf and
Tumble onto the Ferry.

                    SAM
              (screaming)
          Frodo!

Frodo races across the Wooden Wharf, followed by the
ringwraiths. He leaps into the Ferry.

CLOSE ON: HOOVES THUNDER DOWN THE WOODEN WHARF!

Sam and Merry shove off with the poles...the ferry slides out
into the river, just as the ringwraiths arrive. They pull up
on the end of the wharf... shrieking with rage! The Hobbits
cover their ears. The Ringwraiths wheel their horses towards
the north and Gallop away along the river bank, quickly
disappearing into the fog.

                    FRODO
          How far to the nearest crossing?

                    MERRY
          The brandwine bridge...twenty miles.

FRODO, SAM, MERRY AND PIPPIN approaching the gatehouse...wild
eyes, ragged, and out of breath.

                     FRODO
          Come on.

A SURLY GATEKEEPER glances down at them.

                    GATEKEEPER
          What do you want?

                    FRODO
          We're headed for the prancing pony.

The gatekeeper swings his lantern onto the hobbits, bathing
them in an uncomfortable yellow spotlight.

                    GATEKEEPER
          Hobbits! Four Hobbits, and what's more,
          out of the Shire by your talk. What
          business brings you to Bree?

                    FRODO
          We wish to stay at the inn...our business
          is our own. To Frodo's relief, the
          Gatekeeper unlocks the gate.

                    GATEKEEPER
          All right, young sir, I meant no offense.

The Hobbits gratefully enter Bree...the gatekeeper eyeing
them curiously in the lantern light.

                    GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
          It's my job to ask questions after
          nightfall. There's talk of strange fold
          abroad...can't be too careful.

Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin come rushing in.   Frodo attracts
the INN KEEPERS'S attention.

                       FRODO
          Excuse me.

                     BUTTERBUR
          Good evening, little masters. If you're
          seeking accommodation, we've got some
          nice, cozy Hobbit sized rooms available,
          Mr...ah...

                    FRODO
          Underhill...my name's Underbill.

                       BUTTERBUR
          Underhill?     Hmmmm.

                    FRODO
          We're friends of Gandalf the Grey...can
          you tell him we've arrived? BUTTERBUR
          frowns...

                    BUTTERBUR
              (Puzzled)
          Gandalf...Gandalf...Oh...
              (recognition)
          Oh yes! I remember...elderly chap...big
          grey beard...pointy hat? Frodo nods with
          relief...Butterbur shakes his head.

                    BUTTERBUR (CONT'D)
          Not seen him for six months. Frodo is
          shocked.

                    SAM
              (worried whisper)
          What do we do now?

INT. PRANCING PONY INN -- NIGHT

Wide on: the noise, smokey Inn. It is dimly lit, cheifly
from a blazing log fire...and crowded with a mixture of BIG
FOLK, LOCAL HOBBITS, and a couple of dwarfs. Frodo, Sam,
Merry and Pippin are sitting at a table against the wall...
clearly trying to remain Quiet and inconspicuous... Sam can't
help himself...he keeps casting nervous glances around.

                    FRODO
          Sam, he'll be here.    He'll come.

Merry ploinks himself down at a table, carrying a very large
mug of beer.

                    PIPPIN
          What's that?

                    MERRY
          This, my friend, is a pint.

                    PIPPIN
          It comes in pints?    I'm getting one!

Sam watches Pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to
the bar.

                    SAM
          You've had a whole half already. Merry
          watches Pippin go.

A COUPLE OF SWARTHY MEN leaning against the bar glance at
Frodo, then quickly look away.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
              (tense)
          That fellow's done nothing but stare at
          you since we've arrived.

Sam indicates a BROODING STRANGER who sits alone at a table
in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed
pipe, peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with
gleaming eyes. Frodo gestures to Butterbur...

                    FRODO
          Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is
          he?

                    BUTTERBUR
          He's one of them Rangers; they're
          dangerous folk they are, wandering the
          wilds. What his right name is, I never
          heard, but round here he's known as
          Strider.

                    FRODO
              (to himself)
          Strider.

BENEATH TABLE: FRODO'S fingers are nervously TOYING WITH THE
RING.

                                                            47.



CLOSE ON: FRODO

Sweat runs down his brow.   The Strange hum of the Ring spills
into the Soundtrack.

"Baggins...Baggins..." a creepy whisper seems to fill Frodo's
head...sound that dissolves into Pippin's loud voice:

                    PIPPIN
          Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins...he's
          over there...

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN

sitting at the bar, chatting with Locals.   Frodo leaps to his
feet and pushes his way towards the bar.

                    PIPPIN
              (loudly)
          Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin
          once removed, on his mother's side and my
          third cousin twice removed on his
          father's side...if you follow me.

Frodo grabs Pippin's sleeve, spilling his beer.

                    FRODO
          Pippin!

                    PIPPIN
          Steady on, Frodo!

Pippin pushes Frodo away...he stumbles backwards, and falls
to the floor. At that instant, the Inn goes silent and all
the attention turns to Frodo...

                                                      CLOSE ON:

The ring...in agonizing Slow motion we watch as it seems to
hang in the air for a split second...then crashes down onto
his out stretched finger. FRODO VANISHES! There is a sharp
intake of breath...followed by total silence.

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. BREE COUNTRYSIDE -- NIGHT

The RINGWRAITHS turn sharply in their saddles...Instantly
aware that the ring is being worn. They spur their horses
towards the distant lights of Bree.

INT. "PRANCING PONY" INN -- NIGHT

Sam looks sick; Pippin instantly sobers, realizing his folly;
the brooding stranger frowns...and the inn erupts into
excited babble.

                                        IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:

                                                      ANGLE ON:

FRODO: as he finds himself in the TWILIGHT WORLD of the ring:
THE EXCITED CROWD ARE suddenly moving in slow
motion...distorted voices...a weird photographic negative
quality. FRODO is moving in real time; against the slow
motion background. He suddenly clutches his head as he is
hit with quick images...of a GREAT EYE! AN EVIL CAT-LIKE
EYE, wreathed in flames.

VOICE OF SAURON

There is no life here in the void...only cold...only death...
FRODO is terrified! He rolls under a table, desperately

          I carry nothing.

          Not nearly frightened enough. I know
          what hunts you. Frodo jumps at the sound
          of a noise in the corridor. Strider
          deftly draws his sword.

The door bursts open and Sam, Merry and Pippin appear on the
doorway. Sam is Squaring off with is fists, Merry brandishes

          Great Kings of men. Then Sauron the

          them without question, one by one falling
          into darkness and now they are slaves to
          his will.

Strider looks from the window as the Ringwraiths gallop down

Hobbits, his face lit faintly by the Glowing Embers of the

Strider stares at Pippin blankly, then turns away, shaking
his head.

blade shatters...the WITCH KING lashes out with his fist,
sending Sam flying. Merry and Pippin, overcome with terror,
throw themselves flat on the ground. THE RINGWRAITHS close in
on Frodo...a Venomous whisper dances in his head...

Frodo shuts his eyes and staggers back, desperately resisting
the WRAITH'S WHISPERINGS... slow motion as his hand goes into
his pocket and pulls out the ring. The 5 Ringwraiths utter a
chilling SCREECH OF EXCITEMENT. Frodo is unable to resist any
longer, falls to his knees and slips on the ring. He

Frodo finds himself in the weird twilight world...he looks
upon the Ringwraiths, now visible in their TRUE APPEARANCE:
Five Ghouls dressed in long Grey robes, with white hair, and
Pallid, ruthless faces. THE WITCH KING extends a haggard hand
towards Frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger. Frodo's
trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the
ring...he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away.
The witch king snarls and springs forward. He stabs at Frodo
with a wicked dagger! Frodo winces as the tip of the dagger
sinks into his shoulder. Suddenly, Strider charges at the
RINGWRAITHS, wielding his sword in one hand, a flaming torch
in the other. He moves in slow motion, visible through a sea
of mist. Frodo sinks to the ground. Behind him is a faint
image of a Ringwraith fleeing, his head engulfed in flames.
With draining strength, Frodo manages to pull the ring off
his finger...

top of Orthanc, surrounded by a sheer 500 foot drop. He
looks Weak and Frail...and is seemingly asleep. The MOTH
flutters close to Gandalf. His hand suddenly moves at

close to his face and opens it. The moth sits on the palm of
his hand as Gandalf mutter strange words in a foreign tongue.

The dead trees of Isengard are fed into roaring
furnaces...molten metal pours into casts...red hot metal,
beaten my sweating orc blacksmiths...armor and weapons are
forged from the great furnaces. Saruman strides among the
ORCS and stands looking on a new born uruk-hai as it escapes
its birthing membrane...this is LURTZ, who rises up to stand
before his master.

          No. He is passing into the shadow world,

Without hesitation, the white horse leaps into the shallow
water and thunders across the Ford. The 9 Ringwraiths pull up
short of the Ford, clearly nervous of the water. The white
horse reaches the other side...Arwen pulls up and turns to
defiantly face the Ringwraiths from across the Ford.

                    WITCH KING
          Give up the Halfling, she-elf! She draws

THE GROUND SUDDENLY TREMBLES...A MIGHTY ROAR FILLS THE AIR!

Frodo looks up weakly...to see a vast torrent of Water
flooding down the river towards the ford...as if a dam had
burst! The Foaming water seems to form the shape of Dancing
white horses with frothing manes! The Ringwraiths scream in
terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge. Their Piercing

              (slightly embarrassed)
          No harm in being prepared. Frodo strolls
          to the edge of the Balcony.

                    FRODO
          I thought you wanted to see the Elves,
          Sam?



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                    SAM
          I do...

                    FRODO
          More than anything.

                    SAM
          I did. It's just...we did what Gandalf
          wanted, didn't we? We got the Ring this
          far, to Rivendell...and I thought...
          seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be
          off soon. Off home.

                    FRODO
          You're right, Sam. Frodo looks at Sam...

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          ...we did what we set out to do. Frodo
          opens his hand, the Ring sits in his
          Palm.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          The ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am
          ready to go home.

EXT. ELROND'S CHAMBER, RIVENDELL -- DAY

Gandalf and Elrond watch Frodo and Sam from Elrond's balcony,

                    ELROND
          His strength returns.

                    GANDALF
          That wound will never fully heal. He will
          carry it the rest of his life.

                    ELROND
          And yet to have come so far still bearing
          the Ring...the hobbit has shown
          extraordinary resilience to its evil.

                    GANDALF
          It is a burden he should never have to
          had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.

                    ELROND
          Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's
          forces are massing in the east. His eye
          is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you
          tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of
          allies grows thin.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          69.
CONTINUED:


                    GANDALF
          His treachery runs deeper than you know.
          By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc
          with Goblin Men...he is breeding an army
          in the caverns of Isengard. An army that
          can move in Sunlight and cover great
          distance at speed. Saruman is coming for
          the Ring.

Elrond turns and walks away...

                    ELROND
          This evil cannot be concealed by the
          power of the Elves...We do not have the
          strength to fight both Mordor and
          Isengard...Gandalf...the ring cannot stay
          here.

Gandalf turns and looks out the window.

Sounds of arrivals...Gandalf watches as Boromir rides through
Rivendell gate, followed by Legolas and Gimli.

                    ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          This peril belongs to all Middle earth.
          They must decide how to end it. Not just
          for themselves but for those who come
          after. Elrond approaches Gandalf.

                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          The time of the Elves is over. My people
          are leaving these shores. Who will you
          look to when we have gone? The dwarves?
          They hide in their mountains seeking
          riches. They care nothing for the
          troubles of others.

                    GANDALF
          It is in Men that we must place our hope.

                    ELROND
          Men? Men are weak.      The race of Men is
          failing. The blood     of Numenor is all but
          spent, its pride and    dignity forgotten.
          It is because of men    the Ring survives.

FLASH INSERT: With the broken sword, Isildur slices off
Sauron's finger. Elrond reacts.

                    ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          I was there, Gandalf...I was there three
          thousand years ago when Isildur took the
          ring.

                                                               70.



FLASH INSERT: ISILDUR PICKS UP THE RING AND STARES AT IT,

ENTRANCED.

                       ELROND
             I was there the day the strength of Men
             failed.

             volcano.

                       ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
             I let Isildur into the heart of Mount
             Doom, where the ring was forged: the one
             place it could be destroyed.

FLASH INSERT: ELROND AND ISILDUR STAND BEFORE THE FIRES OF

MT. DOOM.

                       ELROND
             Cast it into the fire...destroy it!

CLOSE ON: ISILDUR...CAPTIVATED BY THE RING.

                         ISILDUR
             No.

Isildur turns and walks away

                         ELROND
             Isildur!!

INT. ENROND'S CHAMBER, RIVERDELL -- DAY

Elrond turns to Gandalf.

                       ELROND
             It should have ended that day, but evil
             was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the
             Ring...and the line of Kings was broken.
             There's no strength left in the world of
             Men. They're scattered, divided,
             leaderless.

          There is one who could unite them, one
          who could re claim the thrown of Gondor.

                    ELROND
          He turned from that path a long time ago.
          He has chosen exile.

INT. ELROND'S CHAMBER, RIVENDELL -- NIGHT

Strider watches from the shadows...as Boromir strolls through
the darkened gallery. Boromir's eyes are drawn to an old
Fresco on the wall...depicting Isildur defeating Sauron.
Boromir looks with Wonderment at Narsil, the Broken Blade of
Elendil, which lies on a cloth-covered plinth.

                    BOROMIR
              (quiet awe)
          The shards of Narsil...the blade that cut
          the Ring from Sauron's hand. Boromir
          picks up the sword and gently touches the
          Blade. Close on: a small bloom of blood
          appears on Boromir's finger...

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          Still sharp.

Boromir senses Strider's presence...he looks from the blade
to Strider, as if sensing a connection.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          But no more than a broken heirloom.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          replaces the Broken blade, but it
          clatters to the floor. Boromir walks
          away, leaving Strider sitting alone.

Close on: Strider picks up the broken hilt, as Arwen appears
behind him.

                    ARWEN
          Why do you fear the past? You are
          Isildur's heir...not Isildur himself. You
          are not bound to his fate.

                    STRIDER
          The same blood flows in my veins...the
          same weakness...

Night falls upon the beautiful valley of Rivendell... still
and quiet.

EXT. RIVENDELL WATERFALL -- NIGHT

Strider and Arwen stand upon a stone bridge...the Evenstar at
Arwen's breast shines in the moonlight.

                    ARWEN

          Renech I lu I erui govannem?   Do you

          Nauthannim I ned ol reniannen.   I thought
          I had strayed into a dream.

Arwen reaches up and gently touches the Grey at Strider's
temples.

          Gwenin in enniath...u-arnech in naeth I

Arwen looks into Strider's eyes.

          Renech I Beth I pennen? Do you remember

              (quietly)
          You said you'd bind yourself to me,
          forsaking the immortal life of your

          And to that I hold. I would rather share
          one lifetime with you than face all the
          ages of this world alone. Strider looks
          down. In his hand lies the Evenstar.

                    ARWEN (CONT'D)
          I choose a mortal live.

                    STRIDER
          You cannot give me this.

          It is mine to give to whom I will, like
          my heart.

Arwen closes Strider's fingers around the jewel.

Arwen leans towards Strider, gently kissing him.

INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER, RIVENDELL -- DAY

Elrond addresses the council...

                    ELROND
          Strangers from distant lands ... friends
          of old. You have been summoned here to
          answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-earth
          stands upon the brink of destruction.
          None can escape it. You will unite...or
          you will fall. Each race is bound to this
          fate...this one doom...

Frodo sits amongst a council of free-peoples of Middle earth,
Elrond stands before them, addressing Gandalf, Strider,
Legolas, and 20 other elves, Dwarves, and men.

                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

Frodo steps forward and moves towards a stone Plinth. He
places the ring on the plinth and returns to his seat.

                    BOROMIR
              (shocked)
          So it is true!

                    LEGOLAS

          Sauron's Ring! The ring of power!

          The doom of man!

                    BOROMIR
          It is a gift...a gift to the foes of
          Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has
          my father, the Steward of Gondor, held
          the forces of Mordor at bay...by the
          blood of our people are your lands kept
          safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the
          enemy...let us use it against him!

                    STRIDER
          You cannot wield it. None of us can.
          The one ring answers to Sauron alone...it
          has no other master. Boromir turns and
          looks at Strider, coolly.

                    BOROMIR
          And what would a ranger know of this
          matter?

Strider says nothing and Boromir turns away dismissively.
LEGOLAS stands...

                    LEGOLAS
          This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn,
          son of Arathorn. You owe him your
          allegiance.

Frodo looks at Strider questioningly...Boromir turns sharply.

                    BOROMIR
              (quiet disbelief)
          Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?

                    LEGOLAS
          And heir to the throne of Gondor.

                    ARAGORN

          Havo dad, Legolas...Sit down, Legolas..

          Gondor needs no king.

                    GANDALF
          Aragorn is right...we cannot use it.

                    ELROND
          You have only one choice..the ring must
          be destroyed.

The HUM OF THE RING seems to grow louder in Frodo's ears.
Gimli suddenly stands, excited.

                    GIMLI
          Then...what are we waiting for?

Gimli suddenly rushes forward! He swings his axe down on the
ring. The axe shatters with a deafening crack! Gimli falls
backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring...unharmed! Frodo
winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him! He slumps
in this chair, clutching his forehead. Gandalf looks at him
with concern.

                    ELROND
          The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son
          of Gloin, by any craft that we

                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          here possess. The ring was made in the
          fires of Mount Doom...only there can it
          be unmade. It must be taken deep into
          Mordor, and cast back into the fiery
          chasm from whence it came. One of you
          must do this.

Stunned silence...the council sits with downcast eyes, as if
a great dread has descended on them. Boromir addresses the
council in a quiet voice

                    BOROMIR
          One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its
          black gates are guarded by more than just
          Orcs. There is evil there that does not
          sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful.
          It is a barren wasteland, riddled with
          fire and ash and dust...the very air you
          breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with
          ten thousand men could you do this. It
          is folly.

                    LEGOLAS
          Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has
          said? The ring must be destroyed.

                    GIMLI
          And I suppose you think you're the one to
          do it?

                    BOROMIR
          And if we fail, what then? What happens
          when Sauron takes back what is his?

Gimli leaps to his feet!

          erupts around the room. CLOSE ON:
          FRODO...sound disappears as he watches in
          slow

motion...the angry faces, the shaking fists, the accusatory
fingers, his eyes move across to the ring...the hum grows
louder in his head.

                    GIMLI (CONT'D)
              (shouting)
          Never trust an Elf!

CLOSE ON: THE RING fills the screen...streams of blood flow
across the surface... flames flicker within the Gold Band.

                    GANDALF
          Do you not understand? While we    bicker
          among ourselves, Sauron's power   grows!
          No one will escape it. You will   all be
          destroyed, your homes burnt and   your
          families put to the sword!

CLOSE ON: FRODO...breathing rapidly, Caught in the grip of
his hideous vision. With a huge effort or will, Frodo tears
his gaze upon the ring. Frodo suddenly stands...he speaks in
a strong, clear voice.

                    FRODO
          I will take it...I will take it...I will
          take the Ring to Mordor.

Sudden silence...Frodo looks around the room at the astounded
faces.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
              (quietly)
          Though...I do not know the way. Gandalf
          rises to his feet.

                    GANDALF
          I will help you bear this burden, Frodo
          Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.

                    ARAGORN
          If, by my life or death, I can protect
          you, I will.
              (kneels before Frodo)
          ...you have my sword. Aragorn steps
          forward...followed by Legolas and Gimli.

          And you have my bow.

                    GIMLI
          And my axe.

Boromir looks at them all then walks towards Frodo.

                    BOROMIR
          You carry the fate of us all, little one.

Boromir looks towards Elrond and Gandalf.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          If this is indeed the will of the
          Council, then Gondor will see it done.

Frodo stares in wonder as the Greatest Fighters in all Middle
earth stand at his side.

                    SAM
              (unseen)
          Here!

A Sudden Noise...Sam pops up from behind a Bush!

                    SAM (CONT'D)
          Mr. Frodo's not gong anywhere without me.

                    ELROND
          No, Indeed...it is hardly possible to
          separate you...even when he is summoned
          to a secret council and you are not.

Merry and Pippin jump up from behind another bush!

                    MERRY
          Oi! We're coming too! You'll have to
          send us home tied up in a sack to stop
          us.

                    PIPPIN
          Anyway...you need people of intelligence
          on this sort of
          mission...quest...thing...

          Well, that rules you out, Pip.

ELROND SURVEYS THE GROUP

                    ELROND

          Nine companions ... so be it.

          You shall be the "Fellowship of the ring"

INT. FRODO'S BEDROOM, RIVERDELL---DAWN

Close on: An old sword sliding out of a shabby leather
Scabbard...its polished, well tendered Blade glitters cold
and bright.

                    BILBO
          My old sword "Sting"...here, take it!

Bilbo offers Sting to Frodo.

                    FRODO
          It's so light!

                    BILBO
          Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know.
          The blade glows blue when Orcs are
          close...and it's times like that, my lad,
          when you have to be extra careful.

Bilbo unwraps a small shirt of close woven Mail.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Here's a pretty thing. Mithril, as light
          as a feather, and as hard as dragon
          scales. Let me see you put it on. Come
          on.

CLOSE ON: Frodo peels off his shirt... revealing The Ring on
the Chain around his neck.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (entranced)
          Oh! My old Ring... Frodo frowns as Bilbo
          moves toward him.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I should very much like to hold it again,
          one last time. Bilbo reaches forward,
          eyes locked on the ring.

CONTINUED:


Suddenly! A shadow passes across Bilbo...for a split second
he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and Bony,
groping hands. Frodo pulls away, shocked...the shadow passes.
Bilbo slumps into a chair, his head in his hands. Bilbo
falters...his eyes filling with tears.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Oh!

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (sad)
          I'm sorry, that I brought this upon you,
          my boy...I'm sorry that you must carry
          this burden. I'm sorry for everything.

Bilbo sobs and Frodo moves to comfort him.

turbulent waters...the misty mountains rise sharply to their
left.

                    GANDALF (V.O.)
          We must hold to his course west of the
          misty Mountains for forty days. If our
          luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still
          be open to us. From there, our road

          Thanks.

CLOSE ON: GIMLI has managed to corner Gandalf....

                    GIMLI
          If anyone were to ask for my opinion,
          which I note they have not, I would say
          we are taking the long way round.
          Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of
          Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a
          royal welcome. Gandalf clearly thinks
          that is a bad idea.

                    GANDALF
          No, Gimli. I would not take the road
          through Moria unless I had no other
          choice.

Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand. Pippin throws
down his sword, kicks and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to
the ground. Much laughter. Legolas' eyes are fixed on a
distant Dark Patch which darts about the sky, like flying
smoke in the wind.

                    SAM
          What is that?

                    GIMLI
          Nothing...it's just a wisp of a cloud.

                    BOROMIR

          little cover

there is...as a regiment of Large crows fly low overhead at
Great speed, wheeling and circling above. As their dark
shadow passes over the fellowship, a single harsh croak is
heard...and the crows suddenly wheel away, back towards the
south. Gandalf staggers to his feet.

                    GANDALF
              (worried)
          Spies of Saruman.    The passage South is
          being watched.

Gandalf looks at Aragorn, turns to the others...gesturing
towards a high mountain pass.

The Fellowship clamber through Rock and Snow. CLOSE ON: Frodo
slips on some shale...as he scrambles to his feet, the Ring
falls on the ground... CLOSE ON: the ring gleaming in the
snow! Boromir's Hand picks it up by the chain...he stands,
the ring dangling before his eyes. He seems to grow in
stature, as if absorbing its power. Aragorn warily approaches
Boromir...Boromir is motionless...he stares at the ring, as
if transfixed.

                     ARAGORN
          Boromir?

                    BOROMIR
          It is a strange fate that we should

Saruman's voice strengthens...rolling past the fellowship
like thunder. A LIGHTNING CRACK explodes on the mountainside
above them. Frodo looks up in horror as a huge snow avalanche
thunders down towards them! The Fellowship throw themselves
against the cliff face as snow crashes onto the narrow ledge.
LEGOLAS pulls Gandalf to safety. Aragorn shields Frodo and
Sam as snow piles around them. Within moments, the pass is

Footing is treacherous on the narrow strip of green and

luminous silver running through the stone.

Black Rippling rings slowly fan out. Pippin is about to
throw another stone, but Aragorn grabs his arm.

                    ARAGORN
              (ominous)
          Do not disturb the water.

Aragorn watches anxiously as the Ripples appear to grow....he
exchanges a look with Boromir.

Aragorn's hand creeps towards his sword. Gandalf gives up in
despair...he sits down beside Frodo. Close on: Frodo peers at
the Elvish inscription...his face breaks into a smile of
comprehension.

                    FRODO
              (quietly)
          It's a riddle...

Gandalf raises his eyebrows...

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
              (explaining)
          Speak, friend, and enter.   What's the
          Elvish for friend?

                    GANDALF
          Oh...mellon.

With that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and
two great Doors swing outwards... revealing a blackness
deeper than the night. As the Fellowship enter the Blackness,
something in the water stirs....

INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

The Fellowship step warily into the darkness of Moria...a
Dank cavern, with winding steps leading deeper into the
mountain.

                    GIMLI
          So, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled
          hospitality of the dwarves; roaring
          fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone.
          This, my friend, is the home of my
          cousin, Balin...and they call this a
          Mine...
              (snorting)
          A mine!

A Glow from Gandalf's Staff suddenly lights    the chamber...
The Fellowship recoil in Horror! Many dwarf    Skeletons are
strewn about, clearly the dead of some old    battle...the
rusting armor and shields are peppered with    arrows and axes.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           87.
CONTINUED:


                    BOROMIR
              (grimly)
          This is no mine...it's a tomb!

                    GIMLI
              (in horror)
          Oh...no...no..no... ! Legolas pulls a
          crude arrow out of a skeleton.

                     LEGOLAS
          Goblins!

The Fellowship draw swords and back away, towards the
Entrance.

                    BOROMIR
          We make for the Gap of Rohan.    We should
          never have come here.

EXT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

Frodo is suddenly PULLED TO THE GROUND. A long sinuous
Tentacle is wrapped around Frodo's ankle and is dragging him
towards the lake. FRODO CRIES OUT as Aragorn and Boromir rush
forward! Aragorn severs the Tentacle holding Frodo, and pulls
him to safety...Boromir hacks at the other Writhing Limbs. 20
more tentacles ripple out of the Lake! The dark water Boils
as the hideous beast lashes out at the FELLOWSHIP! Again the
creature grabs Frodo and pulls him to the lake, Frodo is
flung in the air as the Fellowship battle the creature.
Aragorn hacks at a tentacle...Frodo is released, falling into
Boromir's arms.

                    GANDALF
          Into the mines!

                     BOROMIR
          Legolas!

Legolas shoots an Arrow into the creature's head, gaining a
few vital seconds for Aragorn and Boromir as they race out of
the water with Frodo. The FELLOWSHIP hurriedly back away from
the Creature... retreating into the Moria Chamber as many
Coiling arms seize the large doors.

INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away,
creating a rock slide that crashes down the Cliff Face.
Within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway... throwing the
Fellowship into Pitch Blackness.

CONTINUED:


A faint light rises from Gandalf's staff, throwing a Creepy
Glow across the old wizards face.

                    GANDALF
              (ominous)
          We now have but one choice...we must face
          the long dark of Moria. Be on your
          guard...there are older and fouler things
          than the Orcs in the deep places of the
          world.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. NEW CHAMBER, MORIA -- NIGHT

WIDE ON: the Fellowship crossing a precarious bridge above
deep mine workings.

                    GANDALF
          Quietly, now. It's a four day journey to
          the other side. Let us hope that our
          presence will go unnoticed.

INT. MORIA CEMETERY CAVERN -- NIGHT

They continue up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf
cemetery. The graves are despoiled...dwarf skeletons are
strewn about and Goblin Graffiti is scrawled on monuments in
dried Dwarf blood. The Atmosphere is very sinister.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. MORIA TUNNEL FORK -- NIGHT

The path splits into three passages...each disappearing into
dark tunnels. Gandalf pauses, frowning.

                    GANDALF
          I have no memory of this place.

LATER... The Fellowship are nervously waiting...while Gandalf
sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of
him. He appears to be in some kind of trance.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

He turns at the sound of a faint noise down the tunnel behind
them.

                    PIPPIN
          Are we lost?

                    MERRY
          No. I don't think we are.   Shhhh,
          Gandalf's thinking.

                    PIPPIN
          Merry!

                    MERRY
          What?

                    PIPPIN
          I'm hungry.

Frodo's POV: a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the
darkness. Frodo is nervous...he approaches Gandalf.

                    FRO DO
              (whispers)
          There's something down there.

                    GANDALF
              (quietly)
          It's Gollum.

                    FRODO
          Gollum!

                    GANDALF
          He's been following us for three days.

TEASING SHOT: and emaciated, leering creature.

                    FRODO
              (disbelieving)
          He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?

                    GANDALF
          Escaped...or was set loose. And now the
          Ring has drawn him here...he will never
          be rid of his need for it. He hates and
          loves the ring, as he hates and loves
          himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story.
          Gandalf catches Frodo's look of surprise.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Yes...Smeagol he was once called...Before
          the ring came to him, before it drove him
          mad.

Gollum's withered fingers are gripping the cave wall...he is
large, Luminous eyes blinking with malice.

CONTINUED: (2)


                    FRODO
             (grim)
         It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he
         had the chance.

                   GANDALF
         Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's
         hand. Many that live deserve death, and
         some that die deserve life. Can you give
         it to them, Frodo? Frodo frowns.

                   GANDALF (CONT'D)
         Do not be too eager to deal out death in
         judgment...even the very wise cannot see
         all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum
         has some part to play yet, for good or
         ill, before this is over. The pity of
         Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

                   FRODO
         I wish the ring had never come to me...I
         wish none of this had happened.

                   GANDALF
         So do all who live to see such times, but
         that is not for them to decide. All we
         have to decide is what to do with the
         time that is given to us. There is a note
         of finality in Gandalf's voice.

                   GANDALF (CONT'D)
         There are other forces at work in this
         world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
         Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In
         which case, you also were meant to have
         it...and that is an encouraging thought,
             (sudden brightness)
         Ah! That it's that way! Gandalf points
         at the right hand tunnel...the Fellowship
         scramble to their feet.

                   MERRY
             (relieved)
         He's remembered!

                   GANDALF
         No, but the air doesn't smell so foul
         down there. If in doubt, Meriadoc,
         always follow your nose!
             (laughs)
         Ye s...

                                                               91.



INT. DWAROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA -- DAY

The Fellowship pass under an arched doorway into a black and
empty space. Gandalf pauses...

                    GALADRIEL
          Let me risk a little more light. Gandalf
          taps his staff...for a brief moment a
          light

blazes... like a silent Flash of Lightning.    Great shadows
spring up and flee...

                    GANDALF
          Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city
          of Dwarrowdelf! Frodo gasps at the brief
          sight of a vast roof, far above

their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone.
Before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls,
polished and smooth as glass.

                    SAM
          Well, there's an eye opener and no
          mistake!

Ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. Black arrows
are embedded in the timbers. Two goblin skeletons lie in the
doorway. Gimli rushes ahead...

                    GANDALF
          Gimli!!

                                                        CUT TO:

INT. BALIN'S TOMB, MORIA -- DAY

Gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber... lit with a
narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near
the roof. Dwarf and Goblin skeletons are piled high. In the
far corner sits a stone walled Well. A shaft of light falls
directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room: a
single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great
slab of white stone. Gimli falls to his knees...

                    GIMLI
          No...no...oh, no!

Gimli sobs.

Gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto
the white stone slab.

            "Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of
            Moria." He is dead, then. It's as I had
            feared.

Gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from
the white stone slab. It has been slashed and stabbed...and
appears to be covered in Dried Blood. The pages crack and
break as he opens it...

                      LEGOLAS
                (urgent whisper to Argorn)
            We must move on, we cannot linger.

                      GANDALF
                (reading)
            "They have taken the Bridge and the
            second hall: we have barred the
            gates...but cannot hold them for
            long...the ground shakes...drums in the
            deep...we cannot get out. A shadow moves
            in the dark. Will no- one save us? They
            are coming."

Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously...He stumbles against
the well, sending a precariously balanced Armored skeleton
tumbling in! Merry reaches out, Grabbing hold of Pippin
before he falls. The Fellowship freeze in stunned silence as
the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well...echoing
loudly!

INT. MORIA CAVERNS -- DAY

Gandalf turns angrily on Pippin.

                      GANDALF
                (angry)
            Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next
            time and rid us of your stupidity!

ANGLE ON:    PIPPIN, CHASTENED.

They fall silent. A low rolling boom rises from the depths
below...growing louder...BOOM...BOOM...as if the caverns of
Moria were turned into a vast drum. A great horn blasts
nearby...Answering horns ... running feet...harsh cries...
Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt...

                       SAM
                (worried)
            Mr. Frodo!

Frodo looks down. A cold blue glow is emanating from Sting's
Scabbard! Frodo draws the Sword...and stares at its glowing
blade!

                     LEGOLAS
          Orcs !

                    ARAGORN
              (to the hobbits)
          Get back! Stay close to Gandalf.

Aragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors. Boromir
catches sight of something; he turns to Aragorn with shock in
his eyes.

                    BOROMIR
          They have a cave troll!

Gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the
tomb.

                    GIMLI
              (yelling)
          Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in
          Moria who still draws breath!

BOOM! The Door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments,
and 20 Goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave
troll! Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his Axes in
2 Goblin helmets. Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of
Goblins with their swords. Legolas fires deadly arrows into
Goblin throats, desperately trying to Shield the Hobbits!
Gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle! The
cave troll is sweeping his club at Aragorn...who stumbles
backwards...the huge club descends for the killing
blow...suddenly, in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword
slices into the Scaly arm of the troll; it rears back,
spewing green blood! Sam is backing up against a wall...a
sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. In desperation
he swings wildly at a Goblin with a saucepan! It keels
over...Sam looks surprised. He wallops another Goblin and it
too, drops.

                    SAM
          I think I'm getting the hang of this.

The Cave Troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest
with his spear.

                     FRODO
          Aragorn!   Aragorn!

Sam screams as Frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip
and slammed against the wall.

                    ARAGORN
              (shocked yell)
          Frodo!!

The hobbits go crazy. Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee,
bringing him down...Merry and Pippin jump on him...Legolas
fires an arrow...and the cave troll topples, dead. Aragorn
rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor...Frodo
appears to be dead. Close on: Gandalf, Aragorn, Hobbits
looking horrified... Suddenly Frodo coughs...takes a huge
breath.

                    SAM
          He's alive!

                    FRODO
          I'm alright. I'm not hurt.

                    ARAGORN
          You should be dead. That spear would've
          skewered a wild boar!

                    GANDALF
          I think there's more to this hobbit than
          meets the eye.

Frodo open his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest.   The Troll
Spear did not pierce the mithril."

                    GIMLI
          Mithril! You are full of surprises,
          Master Baggins.

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM     the sound of the drums rings out again!
Gandalf turns to the others.

                    GANDALF
          To the bridge of Khazad-dum!

They hurry towards a distant door...as Goblins start
scuttling down the Pillars behind them, like cockroaches!
Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army
that's rushing toward them! SUDDENLY! A deafening roar fills
the air! A fiery light dances down the hallway... the
pillars casting eerie shadows. The Goblins freeze. They back
Fearfully away from the approaching beast...melting into the
darkness.

                    BOROMIR
          What is this new devilry?

A HUGE SHADOW, surrounded by flame, falls across the
hall..the ground shakes...an unearthly sound rumbles...

                    GANDALF
              (quietly)
          A Balrog..a demon of the ancient world!

INT. STAIRWAY OF KHASAD-DUM, MORIA -- DAY

The BALROG, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great
40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames! In one hand is a
blade...like a stabbing tongue of fire; in the other, a WHIP
of many thongs. Aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a
dizzying stairway...Gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his
staff. Close on: Aragorn looks at Gandalf, concerned.

                    GANDALF
          Lead them on, Aragorn.   The bridge is
          near.

Aragorn hesitates...Gandalf looks at him.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Do as I say; swords are no more use here.

THE FELLOWSHIP race down the stairway, Aragorn picks up
Frodo..leaping across a gaping chasm. A NARROW BRIDGE,

Aragorn makes to throw Gimli across the Chasm.

                    GIMLI
          Nobody tosses a dwarf! The BALROG smashes
          through the wall and spreads its vast
          wings.

INT. BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-DUM, MORIA -- DAY

The Fellowship run into a hall...the floor is split with
fissures that spit flame.

                    GANDALF
              (yelling)
          Over the bridge! Fly!

They race towards the slender bridge of stone...without kerb
or rail...at the far end of the hall. The Fellowship
recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge..but Gandalf... the
last..pauses in the middle of the span...he faces the
Balrog...staff in one hand...Sword in the other! Frodo looks
back in horror:

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          You cannot pass!

                    FRODO
              (alarmed yell)
          Gandalf!

                    GANDALF
              (yelling)
          I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
          wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark
          fire will not avail you, flame of Udun.

Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and
draws up to Full Height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall.
Gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow
bridge.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Go back to the shadow! The BALROG slashes
          at Gandalf with its Sword of

flame...Gandalf blocks with his sword...a ringing clash and
the Balrog's sword shatters into molten fragments!

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
              (booming)
          You shall not pass!! The Balrog places
          one foot onto the bridge. Aragorn and
          Boromir race forward, swords drawn.

GANDALF CRIES ALOUD as he summons up his LAST RESERVES OF
STRENGTH!

CONTINUED:

He thumps the bridge with his staff...a blinding sheet of
white flame springs up... the staff shatters...the bridge
breaks... right at Balrog's feet. The stone bridge drops away
into the gulf...from under the Balrog. For a moment, the
great Beast remains poised in the air...then it plunges down:
in slow motion Relief floods Frodo's face..Gandalf remains
trembling on the lip of the broken bridge. Slow motion: As
the Balrog falls, he lashes out with his whip of fire... Slow
motion: The thongs of the whip lash and curl around Gandalf's
knees, dragging him over the brink! Gandalf just manages to
hand on by his fingertips

                    FRODO
              (screaming)
          Gandalf!

                    GANDALF
              (fierce)
          Fly, you fools!

CLOSE ON: Gandalf lets go his grip and falls away...
following the Balrog into the bottomless Abyss! Frodo cries
out! Boromir scoops him up and carries him away.

                     FRODO
          No!

                    ARAGORN
          By nightfall these hills will be swarming
          with Orcs! We must reach the woods of

forest can be seen...Lothlorien!

EXT. EDGE OF LOTHLORIEN--DUSK

WIDE ON: The fellowship run across a forest floor strewn with
yellow flowers..above is a roof of golden leaves, held up by
silver pillars...the trunks of huge, grey trees. Gimli looks
nervously around...

                    GIMLI
          Stay close, young hobbits..they say a
          Sorceress lives in these woods. An elf-
          witch of terrible power. All who look
          upon her fall under her spell...

Frodo hesitates...a STRANGE VOICE whispers in his head...

The FELLOWSHIP are suddenly surrounded by ARMED ELVES.
Deadly arrows aimed at their heads. HALDIR, the Elvish
captain steps forward... he looks at Gimli with disdain.

          The dwarf breathes so loud we could have
          shot him in the dark.

              (Elvish: with subtitles)
          Haldir of Lorien, we come here for your
          help. We need your protection.

                    GIMLI
          Aragorn! These woods are perilous. We
          should go back.

                    HALDIR
          You have entered the realm of the Lady of
          the Wood. You cannot go back.

Haldir's eyes lock onto Frodo.

          Come, she is waiting.

Haldir leads the Fellowship onto a Hill Top.   They look with
wonderment at the vista spread before them.

Several miles towards the South, a Large Hill rises out of
the woods. Upon the hill rise many mighty Mallorn Trees,
taller than any others...Nestled high in the crown of the
mallorns is a Beautiful City. It Gleams in the low rays of
the late afternoon sun..green, gold, and silver. To the east
of Caras Galadhon, the Woods of Lorien run down the pale
gleam of Anduin, the great river. Beyond the River, the land
appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away,
it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. The Sun that lies
on Lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie
beyond.

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP

step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light. The walls
are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the
trunk of the might Mallorn tree, now tapering toward its
crown. Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. His hair
is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no
sign of age upon it. Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady
of the Elves. She has hair of deep gold and timeless,
unsurpassed beauty. Celeborn looks hard at Aragorn...

                    CELEBORN
          Eight there are, yet nine there were set
          out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is
          Gandalf, for I much desire to speak with
          him.

Frodo looks at Galadriel, standing silently beside Celeborn.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
              (softly aloud)
          ...he has fallen into shadow. Galadriel
          looks to Aragorn.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          The Quest stands upon the edge of a
          knife. Stray but a little and it will
          fail, to the ruin of all...Yet hope
          remains while the company is true.

Galadriel's eyes settle on Sam.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go
          now and rest for you are weary with
          sorrow and much toil. Galadriel's eyes
          turn to Frodo...her voice fades.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          Tonight you will sleep in peace.

          GALADRIEL as she is on the other

side... Powerful, divine...no longer of this world..a
Piercing white light surrounds her.

EXT. CARAS GALADHON LAWN -- NIGHT

Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Frodo and Sam are in a
pavilion set among the trees near the fountain. They lie on
soft couches as Elves leave food and wine for them. MOURNFUL
SINGING drifts down from the trees above.

                    LEGOLAS
              (sadly)
          A lament for Gandalf...

                    MERRY
          What do they say about him?

                    LEGOLAS
          I have not the heart to tell you. For me,
          the grief is still too near. Boromir is
          sitting alone...Aragorn approaches him.

                     ARAGORN
          Take some rest..these borders are well
          protected.

Moonlight catches the trace of tears on Boromir's face.
Aragorn kneels down beside him.

                    BOROMIR
          I will find no rest here. I heard her
          voice inside my head...she spoke of my
          father and the fall of Gondor, and she
          said to me: "Even now, there

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          is hope left. But I cannot see it...it
          is long since we had any hope.

CLOSE ON: BOROMIR looks at ARAGORN in despair.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          My father is a noble man, but his rule is
          failing and our..our people lose faith.
          He looks to me to make things right...and
          I would do it, I would see the glory of
          Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it,
          Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion,
          glimmering like a spike of pearl and
          silver, its banners caught high in the
          morning breeze...have you ever been
          called home by the clear ringing of
          silver trumpets?

                    ARAGORN
          I have seen the white city..long ago.

Boromir feels Aragorn's love for Minas Tirith and takes
heart,

                      BOROMIR
            One day our paths will lead us there, and
            the tower guards shall take up the call
             "the Lords of Gondor have returned."

Aragorn returns Boromir's smile...betraying his disquiet
sadness only when Boromir looks away.

LATER....

The Fellowship are asleep on their beds. Gimli is snoring
loudly. CLOSE ON: BARE FEET tread soundlessly across the
lawn. CLOSE ON: Frodo's eyes flicker open...as if by
instinct. GALADRIEL, her White dress glowing in the
moonlight, glances at him. Frodo follows her...as if drawn by
an invisible force.

EXT. GALADRIELS GLADE, LORTHLORIEN -- NIGHT

Upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits
a shallow Silver Basin. Galadriel leads Frodo into the small
Glade.

                      GALADRIEL
            Will you look into the mirror? Frodo
            looks with apprehension at the silver
            basin.

                      FRODO
                (warily)
            What will I see?

Galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug...a
glow rises from the water.

                      GALADRIEL
            Even the wisest cannot tell for the
            mirror shows many things...things that
            were ..things that are...and some things
            that have not yet come to pass.

Frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal...he peers     into the
glossy surface. The night sky is reflected into     the water...
suddenly a figure takes form...the bowed figure     of an old
man, clad in white robes. He walks down a long      road. Frodo
leans closer to the mirror's surface...

                                                          103.



CLOSE ON: GANDALF LIFTS HIS HEAD AND LOOKS DIRECTLY AT FRODO!

FRODO gasps, his face lighting up with hope.

                    FRODO
              (joyous)
          Gandalf!

Gandalf looks at Frodo with a fierce intensity. Frodo
reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror.
Suddenly the image flares, burning out to white. The vision
shifts...Frodo gasps in horror! The Shire is in ruins! The
image suddenly widens to fill the screen...buildings
burning...bodies strewn about...Dark Shapes of ORCS looting
and destroying...Bag End, billowing in flames! The Party
tree is hacked down. Frodo reels back as the mirror seems to
grow...the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing
him entirely.

IMAGE: Hobbiton...now an Industrial wasteland! The fields
and trees destroyed...replaced with Brick factories belching
smoke! IMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled Hobbits into the
Factories! We see Sam...Merry... and Rosie Cotton. Soot-
stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell-
hole! Suddenly, the mirror goes dark...and out of the black
abyss a single eye grows. CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN. Unable
to move or cry out. The ring dangles from his neck, inches
above the water...not shimmering with curls of steam. Fire
erupts around the eye... With a Yell, Frodo pushes himself
away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. Light
instantly fades from the mirror. Frodo comes to his
senses...he is shocked. Galadriel stands still as a statue,
unmoved, untouched by the horror.

                    GALADRIEL
          I know what it is you saw...for it is
          also in my mind. It is the future,
          Frodo. It is what will come to pass if
          you should fail.

Galadriel looks at Frodo intensely...Frodo looks down...in
his hand he is clutching the ring. Frodo looks up at
Galadriel.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          The fellowship is breaking. It has
          already begun. He will try to take the
          ring. You know of whom I speak. One by
          one, it will destroy them all.

                    FRODO (V.O.)
          If you ask it of me, I will give you the
          One Ring.

                    GALADRIEL
          You offer it to me freely...I do not deny
          that my heart has greatly desired this.

Galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before Frodo's
eyes. Frodo is suddenly afraid of her.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          In place of the Dark Lord, you would have
          a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and
          terrible as the Dawn. Treacherous as the
          Sea! Stronger than the foundations of
          the earth...all shall love me and
          despair! Frodo takes a step away from
          Galadriel...

Galadriel suddenly laughs...a slender Elf-woman once more,
clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
              (gently)
          I pass the test.
              (laughs)
          I will diminish and go into the west and
          remain Galadriel. Frodo's confidence
          drains away.

                    FRODO
          I cannot do this alone...

                    GALADRIEL
          You are the ring-bearer, Frodo...to bear
          a ring of power is to be alone. This task
          was appointed to you, and if you do not
          find a way, no one will.

Frodo realizes what her message is.

                    FRODO
          Then I know what I must do. It's
          just...I'm afraid to do it. Galadriel
          kneels down to Frodo's height, staring at
          him intently.

                    GALADRIEL
          Even the smallest person can change the
          course of the future.

The Ring lies in the palm of Frodo's hand...his fingers close
over it.

                    SARUMAN (V.O.)
              (smiles)
          They were Elves once. Taken by the Dark
          Powers ... tortured and mutilated...a
          ruined and terrible form of life. And
          now...perfected. My fighting Uruk-Hai.
          Whom do you serve?

                    LURTZ
              (gutteral rasp)
          Saruman.

INT. CAVERNS BELOW ISENGARD -- DAY

QUICK CUTS: LURTZ is quickly armored...Breastplate...Leg
guards, Helmet...a sword is thrust in Lurtz's hand. The URUK-
HAI are smearing themselves in white paint...a creepy
ritualistic ceremony...the white hand of Isengard is smeared
on bodies, faces, and armor. SARUMAN address a crowd of 200
fully armed URUK-HAI.

                    SARUMAN
          Hunt them down. Do not stop until they
          are found. You do not know pain. You do
          not know fear. You will taste man-flesh.
          Saruman turns to Lurtz.

                    SARUMAN (CONT'D)
              (coldly)
          One of the Halflings carries something of
          great value...bring him to me...alive and
          unspoiled...kill the others.

EXT. ISENGARD -- DAY

Lurtz is leading 200 URUK-HAI out of Isengard..they run fast,
their powerful legs carrying them at speed.

EXT. SILVERLODE RIVER BANK--DAWN

The Fellowship are in small elven boats. They row away from
the Lothlorien Shore into the Silverlode river. Elves
quietly watch them depart. Galadriel gives Frodo a small
Crystal Phial.

                    GALADRIEL
          Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the
          light of Earendil, our most beloved star.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


As the Fellowship's boats drift past, Galadriel stands alone,
watching from the banks of the river. In his head, Frodo
still hears her voice...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          May it be a light for you in dark places,
          when all other lights go out.

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY

The boats pass into the great river Anduin. The Three Elven
boats carry the Fellowship steadily southward. Green trees
slowly give way to a brown and withered land.

EXT. FOREST -- DAY

The Uruk forces are running through the trees with deadly
purpose.

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY

A flock of birds circle high above, Black against the pale
sky. Aragorn watches them with concern.

EXT. PILLARS OF THE KINGS, RIVER ANDUIN--DAWN

The Three Elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky
gorge in the Pre-dawn light. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN, slowly
paddling in the stern.

                    ARAGORN
              (quietly)
          Frodo.

Frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. Wide
on: Two enormous rock statues, towering like 300 foot
pinnacles on either side of the river...carved images of
Gondorian kings of old. They loom over the boats with power
and majesty.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
          The Argonath...

Close on: Aragorn...strangely moved by the beauty of the
silent sentinels. He speaks, almost as if to himself.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (deeply moved)
          Long have I desired to look upon the
          kings of old...my kin.

The fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes
them through the narrow gap between the Statues' feet.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


Wide on: Craning up past the statues vast crumbling heads, to
reveal a large lake only a mile down river...

EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP

As they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded
shore.

                    ARAGORN
          We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the
          boats and continue on foot..we approach
          Mordor from the North.

                    GIMLI
              (gloomy)
          Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding
          our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable
          labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. And
          after that gets even better...a
          festering, stinking marshland, far as the
          eye can see.

                    ARAGORN
          That is our Road...I suggest you take
          some rest and recover your strength,
          Master Dwarf.

                    GIMLI
              (indignant)
          Recover my...

Legolas turns to Aragorn with urgency.

                    LEGOLAS
          We should leave now.

                    ARAGORN
          No. Orcs patrol the Eastern shore. We
          must wait for cover of darkness.

                    LEGOLAS
          It is not the Eastern shore that worries
          me.

Legolas casts a glance around into the Parth Galen forest...

                    LEGOLAS (CONT'D)
          A shadow and a threat has been growing in
          my mind. Something draws near, I can
          feel it.

CONTINUED:


Aragorn looks at Legolas, knowing full well what he means.
Sam has slumped asleep...Merry dumps a small pile of kindling
at Gimli's feet...

                    MERRY
          Where's Frodo?

Sam sits up with a start...Aragorn's head snaps round..his
eyes fly to Boromir's shield which lies abandoned by his camp
bed. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN.... as he realizes Boromir has gone!

EXT. SLOPES OF AMON HEN -- DAY

Frodo is walking beneath the trees...lost in thought. His
feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab...his eyes
follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the
summit of Amon Hen...the seeing seat. A CRACKLING SOUND!
Frodo freezes....

                    BOROMIR
              (quietly)
          None of us should wander alone; you least
          of all. So much depends on you...Frodo?

Frodo turns slowly...he stares at Boromir, tense, cautious.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          I know why you seek solitude. You
          suffer, I see it day by day. Are you
          sure you do not suffer needlessly?

Frodo stands silent for a moment..the murmur of the Wind in
the trees and the distant roar of the falls of Rauros can be
heard

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          Let me help you. There are other ways,
          Frodo..other paths that we might take.

                    FRODO
          I know what you would say, and it would
          seem like wisdom but for the warning of
          my heart.

                     BOROMIR
          Warning?   Against what?

Boromir has started forward towards Frodo, he pulls himself
up.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          We are all afraid, Frodo. But to let that
          fear drive us to destroy what hope we
          have...don't you see that is madness?

                    FRODO
          There is no other way.

                    BOROMIR
          I ask only for the strength to defend my
          people.
              (angrily drops the wood he has
               collected)
          If you would but lend me the ring...

                    FRODO
          No. . .

Frodo steps hurriedly away from Boromir.

                    BOROMIR
          Why do you recoil?   I am no thief.

                     FRODO
              (wary)
          You are not yourself.

                    BOROMIR
          What chance do you think you have? They
          will find you, they will take the ring
          and you will beg for death before the
          end.

Frodo turns to leave.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          You fool! It is not yours save by
          unhappy chance...it might have been mine.
          It should be mine. Give it to me! Give
          me the ring.

Boromir leaps on top of Frodo, grasping for the ring! Frodo
has only moments to act. Frodo rips the ring from around his
neck..and rams it on his finger.

                    FRODO DISAPPEARS
          Boromir spins wildly around, yelling into
          thin air!

                    BOROMIR
          I see your mind...you will take the ring
          to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to
          your death and the death of us all.

            Boromir stumbles and falls. His body
            shakes as if in the Throes of a
            fit...slowly he comes to.

                      BOROMIR (CONT'D)
                (Disoriented)
            Frodo! Frodo! What have I done. Please,

EXT. SEEING SEAT -- DAY

                                          IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:

FRODO races through the misty twilight world, past the foggy
shapes of twisted trees. Somewhere behind him, Boromir's
distraught voice carries from another dimension:

                      BOROMIR (O.S.)
            I'm sorry, Frodo...Frodo...

Frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps...he clambers
up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone
pillars. Frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the
throne of mountain kings. The world of mist swirls around
him. Frodo peers out from the seat...the world seems to
shrink. In all directions, Views of far off lands telescope
towards him through the mist. IMAGES: ORCS spilling out of
holes in the misty mountains... flames rising from
Mirkwood...grim faced easterlings march to war...black ships
sailing into the south. All the power of the Dark Lord is in
motion. Frodo moves his gaze towards the east...fire explodes
against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills
Frodo's vision. A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong,
tower of adamant: Barad-dur, FORTRESS OF SAURON!

SUDDENLY!   SAURON'S EYE LEAPS TOWARD FRODO LIKE A FINGER OF

LIGHT.

SAURON (V.O.)

(IN BLACK SPEECH)

They will fall! Frodo leaps off the seat, and tumbles down
the stairs! The eye sweeps Amon Hen like a searchlight,
seeking its ring! With a huge effort, Frodo wrenches the ring
off his finger...

EXT. SUMMIT OF AMON HEN -- DAY

Frodo lies gasping on the summit of Amon Hen...below the
ancient ruins of the seeing seat.

                                                            111.



AT THAT MOMENT: A BLACK BOOT STEPS INTO SHOT!

Frodo looks up as Aragorn towers over him.

                       ARAGORN
          Frodo?

                     FRODO
              (numb)
          It has taken Boromir. ARAGORN moves
          towards Frodo...

                    ARAGORN
              (urgent)
          Where is the ring?

Frodo backs away from Aragorn...Aragorn is shocked by the
movement.

                       FRODO
          Stay away!

                    ARAGORN
          Frodo...I swore to protect you.

                    FRODO
          Can you protect me from yourself?

Frodo uncurls his fist...in is palm lies the ring! It
glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun...Aragorn's
eyes are drawn to it.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Would you destroy it?

                    ARAGORN
              (kneeling to Frodo)
          I would have gone with you to the end...
          into the very fires of Mordor.

                    FRODO
          I know...Look after the others,
          especially Sam...he will not understand.

Aragorn freezes!   He draws his sword.

                     ARAGORN
              (urgent)
          Go, Frodo!

Frodo hesitates.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (yells)
          Run! Run!!

Frodo backs away into the trees...as 200 URUK-HAI SWARM onto
Amon Hen behind Aragorn!

Aragorn attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman... he
brings two down with his sword...leaping into the ruins as
others close in on him. Frodo scrambles down the hillside,
away from the fight. Aragorn battles the URUK-HAI, amongst
the pillars and blocks of Amon Hen. Despite his bravery, he
is quickly surrounded... SUDDENLY: ELVEN ARROWS smash into
the URUK-HAI. Legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow.
Gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe.

EXT. PARTH GALEN HILLSIDE -- DAY

Frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feet
thunder down behind him.

                       SAM
          Mr. Frodo!

Sam looks around for Frodo. CLOSE ON: LURTZ ordering his
URUKS.

                     LURTZ
          Find the Halflings ... find the
          halflings!

Frodo stumbles and falls...quickly he crawls behind a
tree...above him the sound of Uruk-Hai crashing through the
forest rings out.

                    MERRY (O.S.)
              (urgent whisper)
          Frodo!

Frodo turns to see Merry and Pippin hidden in a hollow, a few
feet away.

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
          Hide here, quick!

                       PIPPIN
          Come on...

Frodo looks at his friends... slowly shakes his head, a great
sadness in his eyes...

                    PIPPIN (CONT'D)
          What's he doing?

Merry's eyes meet Frodo's.        Understanding.

          He's leaving.

                        PIPPIN
          No!

Pippin stands and makes a move toward Frodo...Merry grabs at
his arm.

                        MERRY
          Pippin!

THE ECHO OF BOROMIR'S HORN reaches Aragorn, Legolas, and
Gimli...they are battling their way down the Slopes towards
the lake.

                    LEGOLAS
          The horn of Gondor!

                        ARAGORN
          Boromir!

Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, felling
URUK-HAI in his path...while Legolas and Gimli fight a rear
guard action. MANY URUK-HAI fall to Boromir's sword as he
tries to protect Merry and Pippin...

                        BOROMIR
          Run!   Run!

Lurtz takes aim. A black arrow suddenly thuds into Boromir's
chest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another
arrow...and another, brings him to his knees. Merry and
Pippin are scooped off their feet by URUK-HAI.

                        MERRY & PIPPIN
          Aaaaagh!      Boromir! Boromir!

Lurtz aims his bow at Boromir's heart... suddenly Aragorn
charges at him, smashing the Bow with his sword. They lock
into a deadly battle. Aragorn cuts Lurtz down and races
towards Boromir, who lies slumped against a tree...URUK-HAI
arrows sticking out of his chest. At least 20 dead URUK-HAI
lie heaped around Boromir. His horn lies at his feet...Cloven
in two.

                    BOROMIR
              (painful gasp)
          They took the little ones...

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
              (panicked)
          Frodo...where is Frodo?

                    ARAGORN
          I let Frodo go.

Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze.

                    BOROMIR
          Then you did what I could not.   I tried
          to take the ring from him.

                    ARAGORN
          The ring is beyond our reach now.

                    BOROMIR
          Forgive me, I did not see..I have failed
          you all.

                    ARAGORN
          No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You
          have kept your honor. Aragorn tries to
          bind Boromir's wound.

                    BOROMIR
          Leave it! It is over...the world of Men
          will fall and all will come to darkness
          and my city to ruin..Aragorn..

                    ARAGORN
          I do not know what strength is in my
          blood, but I swear to you... I will not
          let the White City fall, nor your people
          fail...

                    BOROMIR
          Our people...our people...

Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand.   Boromir's
fingers tighten around the hilt.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          I would have followed you, my
          brother...my captain, my King. Aragorn
          lays Boromir down. He is dead.

                    ARAGORN
          Be at peace, son of Gondor. Aragorn bends

                     ARAGORN (CONT'D)
           They will look for his coming from the
           white tower...but he will not return.

EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY

On the lakeshore Frodo stands in front of one of the Elvish
Boats, the ring in his palm. A distraught Sam...running as
hard as he can through the forest...

                        SAM
           Mr. Frodo!

Close on: Frodo looks to the far side of the river...the
camera moves in on the ring.

                     FRODO (V.O.)
           I wish the ring had never come to me..I
           wish none of this had happened...

Tears fall down Frodo's face...

                     GANDALF (V.O.)
           So do all who lie to see such times...but
           that is not for them to decide. All we
           have to decide is what to do with the
           time that is given us.

With renewed determination, Frodo tucks the ring inside his
vest pocket. The small figure of Frodo pushing the Elvish
boat into the water... Sam bursts through the trees and runs
toward the lake...Frodo is already paddling away.

                     SAM
               (anguished)
           Not alone, Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo, in
           the boat, paddling steadfastly away from
           the

shore..tears in his eyes..the voice of Sam carried on the
wind. Frodo whispers to himself

                        FRODO
           No, Sam.

Sam looks at the water...then at the boat.

SPLASH!   FRODO turns to see Sam launching himself into the
water.



                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                            116.
CONTINUED:


                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Go back,Sam. I'm going to Mordor alone.

Sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat.

                    SAM
          Of course you are...and I'm coming with
          you!

                    FRODO
          You can't swim.

Sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing...Frodo
drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat...

                       FRODO (CONT'D)
                 (frightened)
          Sam!

Sam is underwater...hands flailing helplessly as he sinks.
Close on: Frodo's hand grasping Sam's... Frodo pulls a
bedraggled and half drowned Sam into the boat. Frodo and Sam
look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming
down both their faces.

                     SAM
          I made a promise, Mr. Frodo...a promise.
              (fierce passion)
          "Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."
              (sobs)
          And I don't mean to...I don't mean to.

                    FRODO
              (crying)
          Oh, Sam!

Frodo starts to laugh through his tears...the two friends
hug.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Come on then..

The two Hobbits row through the water...

EXT. FALLS OF RAUROS AERIAL -- DAY

Slow motion: Looking down on swiftly flowing
water...Boromir's body slides under camera.

He is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his
chest..his broken horn at his side. Suddenly... the boat
drops away from camera...as it plunges over the massive falls
of Rauros, disappearing into the vapor below.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    LEGOLAS
          If we are quick, we will catch Frodo and
          Sam before nightfall.

Aragorn looks towards the far shore; Frodo and Sam's small
Boat can be seen lying on the distant Riverbank as Frodo and
Sam make off into the forest beyond. He doesn't react.
Legolas turns and looks at Aragorn.

                    LEGOLAS (CONT'D)
          You mean not to follow them...

                    ARAGORN
          Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

                    GIMLI
          Then it has all been in vain...the
          fellowship has failed.

                    ARAGORN
          Not if we hold true to each other. We
          will not abandon Merry and Pippin to
          torment and death, not while we have
          strength left.

Aragorn pulls a HUNTING KNIFE out of his pack and straps it
on.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
          Leave all that can be spared behind...
          CLOSE ON: ARAGORN..a steely light in his
          eye.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (grimly)
          We travel light. Let's hunt some Orc.

                       GIMLI
          Yes!   Ha!

Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli disappear into the Woods,
following the URUK-HAI trail.

EXT. EMYN MUIL HILLTOP -- DAY

Frodo and Sam scramble onto a high ridge.

A distant line of Saw toothed mountains below a dark,
oppressive sky. Black volcanic smoke rises behind the
mountains....MORDOR!

                     FRODO
          Mordor!   I hope the others find a safer
          road.

                    SAM
              (simply)
          Strider'll look after them.

                    FRODO
          I don't suppose we'll ever see them
          again.

                    SAM
          We may yet, Mr. Frodo.   We may.

                     FRODO
          Sam?

Frodo looks at Sam with great affection..despite the grim
outlook, Sam is undeterred...

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          I'm glad you're with me.

          A last alliance of Men and Elves marched

          It was in this moment..when all hope had
          faded, that Isildur, son of the king,
          took up his father's sword.

ISILDUR snatches up the BROKEN BLADE OF NARSIL..The BLADE
severs SAURON'S FINGERS... AND THE ONE RING FLIES from his
body.

          Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of

GONE....VAPORIZED! CLOSE ON: ISILDUR picks up the SEVERED
FINGER and removes the ONE RING...transfixed!

            will of its own.

SUDDENLY!    ARROWS FLY!   They are ambushed by ORCS...ISILDUR

ANDUIN.

            forgotten...were lost.

          My preciousness.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
          The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long
          life. For five hundred years it poisoned
          his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's

          the Ring of Power perceived...its time
          had now come. It abandoned Gollum.

MUDDY FLOOR of a MOUNTAIN TUNNEL...

                      BILBO

            A Ring.

SUDDENLY!   A VOICE SCREAMS...ITS ANGUISH RINGING through the

COLD, DANK TUNNELS...

                       GOLLUM (V.O.)
            Lost!   Lost! My Precious is lost!!

Frightened Bilbo quickly POCKETS the ONE RING and hurries on.

CONTINUED:

White flowers are scattered among the Well seeded grasses.
An idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer... the
figure is reading a book. ON THE SOUNDTRACK: In the distance,
growing louder..over the Gentle clip clop of an approaching
cart and horse can be heard the HUMMING OF A DEEP VOICE to
the tune of "The Road Goes Ever On and On..."

SUDDENLY! The figure in the grass sits up...looking straight
at camera is a handsome young HOBBIT, with dark curly hair
and deep blue eyes. This is FRODO BAGGINS...his EYES alight
with EXCITEMENT! Tossing away the long stem of grass in his
mouth, Frodo runs off.

                                                         CUT TO:

EXT. SHIRE LANE -- DAY

The cart rattles along a leafy lane, driven by a stooped
figure in Grey.

INTERCUT WITH; SHOTS OF FRODO RUNNING... CAREERING DOWN A

HILL. . .JUMPING OVER LOGS... DODGING TREE BRANCHES.

                                                       ANGLE ON:

The shambling OLD PONY snorts and rears as... SUDDENLY FRODO
appears on a bank above the cart.

                    FRODO
          You're late.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF glowers at the young Hobbit...

                    GANDALF
          A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins,
          nor is he early. He arrives precisely
          when he means to.

They look at each other a moment..then both start laughing as
FRODO'S face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front
seat of the cart.

                    FRODO
          It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

Next to Gandalf, we see how small Hobbits are...Frodo is 3
foot 6 inches tall.

                    GANDALF
          You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle
          Bilbo's birthday?

EXT. HOBBITON FIELDS -- DAY

Wide on: The cart rattles past a FIELD LUPIN being tended by

HOBBITS.

                     FRODO
           What news of the outside world? Tell me
           everything!

                                                       ANGLE ON:

Gandalf looks down at Frodo, a twinkle in his eye.

                     GANDALF
           What, everything? Far too eager and
           curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural...

Wide on: The cart rattles over a Stone bridge towards a Busy
Hobbit Marketplace.

                      GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Well, what can I tell you? Life in the
           wide world goes on much as if it has past
           age. Full of its own comings and goings,
           scarcely even aware of the existence of
           Hobbits...

Close on: Gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before
him.

                     GANDALF (CONT'D)
           ...for which I am very thankful.

                                                       ANGLE ON:

Hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the
cart bearing Gandalf and Frodo rolls past the Green Dragon
Inn...towards... Wide on: The party field. Where scOrcs of
Hobbits are busy preparing for the big night.

                     GANDALF (CONT'D)
           Ah, the long expected party. So, how is
           the old rascal? I hear it's going to be
           a Party of Special Magnificence.

                     FRODO
           You know Bilbo...he's got he whole place
           in an uproar.

                     GANDALF
           Oh, well...that should please him.

                    FRODO
          Half the Shire's been invited...

                    GANDALF
          Good gracious, me.

                    FRODO
          He's up to something.

                    GANDALF
          Oh, really?

Frodo shoots a knowing look, as Gandalf averts his eyes.

                    FRODO
          Alright then..keep your secrets. Before
          you came along we Bagginses were very
          well thought of.

                       GANDALF
          Indeed?

                    FRODO
          Never had any adventures or did anything
          unexpected.

                    GANDALF
          If you're referring to the incident with
          the Dragon...I was barely involved...all
          I did was give your Uncle a little nudge
          out the door.

                    FRODO
          Whatever you did...you've been officially
          labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.

                    GANDALF
          Oh, really?

                                                       ANGLE ON:

ODO PROUDFOOT looks up as the Cart passes by, deeply
suspicious.

As the cart rattles into the small village of Hobbiton...a
quaint rustic settlement, nestled amongst rolling green hills
and large trees.

The Hobbits live in Hobbit Holes: neat burrows dug into the
grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens.

                                                     ANGLE ON:

Excited children, chasing after the cart.

                                                     CLOSE ON:

Gandalf ignOrcs the children's cries. The children stand
deflated, watching Gandalf disappear up the lane. At that
moment: spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of
the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children.

                                                     ANGLE ON:

Gandalf smiling to himself, well pleased with his joke. ODO
PROUDFOOT is unable to suppress a chuckle. Frodo stands up in
the cart as Gandalf reigns in the horse.

                    FRODO
          Gandalf... I'm glad you're back. Frodo
          leaps expertly from the cart. Gandalf
          smiles.

                    GANDALF
          So am I, dear boy...so am I

EXT. BAG END -- DAY

Wide on: GANDALF'S CART pulls up outside the gate to BAG
END...a particularly fine example of a Hobbit hole, with a
large round front door set into a grassy hillside. There is
a sign on the gate which reads: "NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON
PARTY BUSINESS." Gandalf strides up to the garden path of Bag
End. He raises his staff and raps on the front door...a
voice calls out:

                     BILBO (O.S.)
          No, thank you! We don't want any more
          visitors, well wishers, or distant
          relations.

                    GANDALF
          And what about very old friends?

Suddenly the door opens and BILBO BAGGINS stands before him.
He is a HOBBIT OF INDERTIMINATE AGE, with a mischievous
Twinkle in his eye. Wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he
looks every inch the eccentric gentleman.

          Bilbo Baggins!

                    BILBO
          My dear Gandalf!

Gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend.

                    GANDALF
          It's good to see you. One hundred and
          eleven years old, who would believe it!

Gandalf looks at him more keenly.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          You haven't aged a day! Gandalf and Bilbo
          laugh together and enter Bag End.

                    BILBO
          Come on, come in!   Welcome, welcome!!

INT. BAG END LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Bilbo leads Gandalf into Bag End...cozy and cluttered with
souvenirs of Bilbo's travels. Gandalf has to stoop to avoid
hitting his head on the low ceiling. Bilbo hangs up Gandalf's
hat on a peg and trots off down the hall.

                    BILBO
              (Calling)
          Tea? Or maybe something stronger... I've
          a few bottles of the Old Winyard left,
          1296...a very good year, almost as old as
          I am. It was laid down by my father. What
          say we open one, eh?

Bilbo disappears into the kitchen as Gandalf looks
around..enjoying the familiarity of Bag End...he turns,
knocking his head on the light and then walking into the
wooden beam. He groans.

                    BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I was expecting you some time last week.
          Not that it matters, you come and go as
          you please, always have done, always
          will.

          You've caught me a bit unprepared, I'm
          afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit
          of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no,
          that might be a little risky...

Gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one
corner...it is Thorin's map of the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf
smiles to himself.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple
          tart...got some custard somewhere. Not
          much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh
          no...we're alright...I've just found some
          sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope
          it's enough.
              (comes into view)
          I could do you some eggs if you like?

Bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as Gandalf
mysteriously appears behind him.

                    GANDALF
          Just tea, thank you.

                       BILBO
          Oh..right.     You don't mind if...?

                    GANDALF
          No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud
          knock on the front door.

MRS. SACKVILLE BAGGINS (O.S.)

Bilbo Baggins, you open this door..I know you're in there.

                    BILBO
          I'm not home.

Gandalf watches, amused as Bilbo tries to hide.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I've got to get away from these
          confounded relatives, hanging on the bell
          all day, never giving me a moment's
          peace. I want to see mountains
          again...mountains, Gandalf... and then
          find somewhere quiet where I can finish
          my book...Oh, Tea!

                    GANDALF
          So, you mean to go through with your
          plan, then?

          Yes, yes...it's all inhand.   All the
          arrangements are made.

                    GANDALF
          Frodo suspects something.

                    BILBO
          'Course he does, he's a Baggins...not
          some block headed Bracegirdle from
          Hardbottle!

          Yes, yes.

                    GANDALF
          He's very fond of you.

                    BILBO
          I know. He'd probably come with me if I
          asked him. I think, in his heart,
          Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the
          woods and the fields... little rivers.
          Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen
          window.

Bilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket...gripping
a small, unseen object.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I feel thin...sort of stretched, like
          butter scraped over too much bread. I
          need a holiday...a very long holiday and
          I don't expect I shall return...in fact,
          I mean not to.

INT. BAG END -- EVENING

Gandalf and Bilbo are sitting on the Bag End porch. Below
them, final preparations are being made on the Party field.
Bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe.

                    BILBO
          Old Toby, the finest weed in
          Southfarthing!

Bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the
air. A tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through
the Center of Bilbo's smoke ring.

          Ohhhh,

EXT. PARTY FIELD, HOBBITON -- NIGHT

BOOM! A FIREWORK explodes into the night sky high above
Hobbiton...in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding
branches. TILT DOWN: with glowing flowers as they rain down
from the branches...evaporating just above the up turned
faces of the delighted party-goers 144 Hobbits, feasting and
drinking Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the
tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories.
Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark
that dances magically from his staff... Bilbo is greeting
visitors. Frodo and SAM sit at a table drinking ale...Frodo
notices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit,
Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away.

                    FRODO
          Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.

                     SAM
               (horrified)
          I think I'll just have myself another
          ale.

                    FRODO
          Oh, no you don't. Go on.

Sam goes to drain his glass... suddenly it is snatched out of
his hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing
throng of dancers.

                                                            15.



ANGLE ON: SAM'S HORRIFIED FACE

as he is Swept away.   Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer.

Gandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework
that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests.

Close on: Bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a
group of young hobbit children.

                    BILBO
              (melodramatic)
          So, there I was...at the mercy of three
          monstrous trolls...Have you ever heard of
          a troll? Do you know what a Troll is?
          Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly
          things..and they're arguing...arguing
          about how they were going to cook us!

ANGLE ON: A LITTLE HOBBIT GIRL'S

upturned face...her eyes growing larger and larger.

                    BILBO
          Whether it be turned on a spit or minced
          in a pie or whether they were going to
          sit on us one by one and squash us into
          jelly! But they spent so long arguing
          the whether-to's and why-for's that the
          sun's first light crept over the top of
          the trees...and turned them all to stone!

STUNNED GASPS from his young Audience greet his astonishing
feat! Close on: MERRY AND PIPPIN, two mischievous Young
Hobbits in their late teens. Pippin scrambles on to the back
of Gandalf's wagon, snatching up a small firework

                    MERRY
              (urgent whisper)
          No, no..the big one...the big one! Pippin
          grabs a huge rocket. CLOSE ON: FIREWORK
          FUSE crackles with flame!

Merry is holding out the big rocket...he looks aghast at the
fizzing fuse that Pippin has just lit.

                    MERRY (CONT'D)

                    PIPPIN
          It is in the ground.

Merry fearfully tosses the Rocket to Pippin!    The fuse
sizzles angrily.

                     MERRY
          Outside!

                    PIPPIN
          It was your idea.

Pippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to Merry.
WHOOSH! The two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in
a shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening
power. The ROCKET ZOOMS over the Party..It suddenly bursts
apart, forming the shape of a great red golden Dragon! Fire
gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and Flies low
towards the startled crowd. Close on: Frodo watches the
Fireworks Dragon with alarm...but Bilbo is oblivious to the
Panicking crowd and impending danger!

                     FRODO
          Bilbo!   Watch out for the dragon!!

                    BILBO
          Dragon? Nonsense...hasn1t been a dragon
          in these parts for a thousand years!

ANGLE ON: FRODO

As he hurriedly pulls Bilbo to the ground, just as the dragon
roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express
train! Hobbits dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents
collapse, food flies everywhere. The fireworks dragon turns a
somersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang!
This gets the biggest Cheer of the night.

ANGLE ON: MERRY AND PIPPIN,

clothes and hair smoking.

                    MERRY
          That was good!

                    PIPPIN
          Let's get another one!

LARGE HANDS suddenly clamp down on Merry and Pippin's ears.
Low angle: Gandalf looking DOWN STERNLY!

MERRY AND PIPPIN

Are leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy
water...with Gandalf sitting nearby, smoking his pipe and
sipping an ale. Cries of "SPEECH! SPEECH" erupt from the
party.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Bilbo stepping on a stool...he bows in gratitude at the
applause.

                       FRODO
          Speech!

                    BILBO

          My dear Bagginses, and Boffins, tooks and
          Brandybucks...Grubbs, Chubbs,
          Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and

          Proudfeet!

                    BILBO
          Today is my one hundred and eleventh
          birthday. Yes, and alas...Eleventy- one
          years is far too short a time to live
          among such excellent and admirable
          Hobbits! Tremendous outburst of approval!

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I don't know half of you half as well as
          I should like; and I like less than half
          of you as well as well as you deserve.

SCATTERED CLAPPING as the guests try to work out if that was
a compliment or not. CLOSE ON: FRODO AND GANDALF smiling to
themselves. CLOSE ON: Bilbo...a strange hum seems to fill his
head. A bead of sweat rolls down his brow.

Bilbo's hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and
holds it behind his back.

          knuckles turn white as he tightens his
          grip on the small object behind his back.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I regret to announce, this is the end. I
          am going now. I bid you all a very fond
          farewell!! Bilbo looks across at Frodo,
          hesitates... then...

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (whisper)
          Goodbye.

Bilbo instantly vanishes. The party explodes into an
uproar... the crowd leaps to its feet.

ANGLE ON: FRODO

staring at the empty stool in disbelief.

EXT. BAG END -- NIGHT

The party is still in an excited uproar... some 50 yards away
as we pan across a moonlit lane to the front door of Bag End.
Door opens, pulled by an invisible hand.

INT. BAG END -- NIGHT

The door quietly closes...Bilbo materializes as he pulls a
plain gold ring off his finger. Bilbo laughs as he tosses the
ring in the air, then places it in his pocket.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Bilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick. He
finds Gandalf looming over him.

                    GANDALF
          I suppose you think that was terribly
          clever?

                    BILBO
          Come on, Gandalf!   Did you see their
          faces?

                    GANDALF
          There are many magic rings in the world,
          Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be
          used lightly.

                    BILBO
          It was just a bit of fun.   Oh, you're
          probably right as usual.

                    GANDALF
          You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?

                    BILBO
          I'm leaving everything to him.

                    GANDALF
          What about this ring of yours?   Is that
          staying too?

Close on: Bilbo...he gives Gandalf a look and nods toward the
mantelpiece.

                    BILBO
          Yes, yes, it's in an envelope...over
          there on the mantelpiece. Gandalf frowns
          at the empty mantelpiece...Bilbo suddenly
          feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty
          surprise.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          No, wait. It's here in my pocket. Isn't
          that...isn't' that odd now? Yet, after
          all, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?

                    GANDALF
          I think you should leave the Ring behind,
          Bilbo. Is that so hard?

                    BILBO
          Well, no...and yes. Now it comes to it,
          I don't feel like parting with it. It's
          mine. I found it. It came to me!

ANGLE ON: GANDALF LOOKS DOWN AT BILBO WITH RISING CONCERN.

                    GANDALF
          There's no need to get angry.

                    BILBO
          Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's
          mine. My own, my precious.

                    GANDALF
          Precious? It's been called that before,
          but not by you.

                    BILBO
          So? What business is it of yours what I
          do with my own things? Bilbo's voice,
          shape and manner have suddenly changed.

                    GANDALF
          I think you've had that ring quite long
          enough.

                    BILBO
          You want it for yourself!

Gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow
suddenly seems to fill the room

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some
          conjurer of cheap tricks! Bilbo cowers
          from Gandalf, disarmed by his power...a
          frightened Hobbit. Gandalf's expression
          softens.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          I am not trying to rob you. I am trying
          to help you. Sobbing, Bilbo runs to
          Gandalf and hugs him.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          All you long years we've been
          friends...trust me as you once did. Let
          it go!

                    BILBO
          You're right, Gandalf...the ring must go
          to Frodo.

Bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          It's late, the road is long... yes, it is
          time.

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo?

                    BILBO
          Hmmm?

Bilbo hesitates...reaches into his pocket.

                     BILBO
          Oh, yes.

CLOSE ON: Bilbo pulls out the ring...he stares at it in his
palm. With all his will power, Bilbo allows the ring to
slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor. CLOSE ON:
The tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor.

Bilbo staggering out of Bag end...he braces himself in the
night air, Pale and Trembling, as if his loss of the ring has
weakened him. Gandalf steps up behind.

                    BILBO
          I've thought up and ending for my
          book..."And he lived happily ever after
          to the end of his days."

                    GANDALF
          I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

                    BILBO
          Goodbye, Gandalf.

                    GANDALF
          Goodbye Bilbo.

Bilbo walks away from Bag End, disappearing into the night,
softly singing: "The Road goes on and on."

locked in thought.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          He talked for so long about leaving...I
          didn't think he'd really do it.

          ...my own.

          Gandalf?

Gandalf turns...his eyes locking onto the ring in Frodo's
fingers.

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo's ring.

Gandalf sorts hurriedly through Bilbo's papers...

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          He's gone to stay with the Elves. He's
          left you Bag End...

Gandalf holds out the envelope...Frodo drops the ring into
it.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          ...along with all his possessions.

Gandolf seals the envelope with wax.   He hands it to Frodo.

          The ring is yours now. But it somewhere
          out of sight. Gandalf rises hurriedly and
          starts to gather his things.

                    FRODO
          Where are you going?

                    GANDALF
          I have some things I must see to.

                    FRODO
          What things?

                       GANDALF
          Questions.     Questions that need
          answering.

                    FRODO
          You've only just arrived!    I don't
          understand...

Gandalf is already at the door, he turns to Frodo.

                    GANDALF
          Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it
          safe.

Gandalf hurries out the door...leaving FRODO standing alone
in the Bag End.

SNORTING HORSE NOSTRILS...as the shadow of a black rider
looms over a Hobbit House. Terrified, FARMER MAGGOT cowers in
his doorway...FANG, his dog, Whimpers and backs away.

              (hissing)
          Shire? Baggins?

          There's no Bagginses around here! They
          are all up in Hobbiton...that way.

FRODO enters Bag End...he immediately Pauses, sensing that
something is amiss. All is quiet...Frodo peers uneasily into
the darkened living room. SUDDENLY! A large figure looms out
of the shadows, reaching for Frodo. Frodo lets out a
startled cry, pulls himself free and spins around to face his
Assailant. Gandalf steps into a shaft of moonlight. Paranoia
blazes in his eyes. His clothes are dirty and ragged from
much traveling. Hair and beard much longer an unkempt.

Frodo pulls the envelope out of an old chest. Gandalf,
suspicious, Alert. Without a word, Gandalf takes the envelope
and tosses it into the fireplace!

              (bewildered)
          What are you doing?

Flames instantly consume the envelope...revealing the ring,
as it sinks into the red hot embers. Gandalf reaches into the
fire with a pair of tongs...he lifts the ring out.

                    GANDALF
          Hold out your hand, Frodo...it is quite
          cool.

Gandalf drops the ring into Frodo's hand...he reacts to its
weight.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)

Mordor?

                    FRODO
          GANDALF

In the common tongue it says, "One ring to rule them all, One
ring to find them, One ring to bring them all, and in the
darkness bind them."

          This is the one ring forged by the dark
          lord, Sauron, in the fires of Mt
          Doom...taken by Isildur from the hand of
          Sauron himself.

CLOSE ON: FRODO...STUNNED

              (quiet realization)
          Bilbo found it...in Gollom's cave.

                    GANDALF
          For sixty years the ring lay quiet in
          Bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life,
          delaying old age...but no longer, Frodo.
          Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has
          awoken. It has heard its master's call.

emanates from the Ring.   Frodo looks at Gandalf, each knowing
the other has heard it.

                     FRODO
          But he was destroyed...Sauron was
          destroyed.

ANGLE ON: THE RING

lies between them on the table.

                    GANDALF
          No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron has
          endured. His life force is bound to the
          ring and the ring survived. Sauron has
          returned. His Orcs have multiplied...his
          fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the
          land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this
          ring to cover all the lands in the second
          darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it,
          all his thought is bent on it. For the
          ring yearns, above all else, to return to
          the hand of its master: they are one, the
          ring and the dark lord. Frodo, he must
          never find out. SUDDENLY Frodo scoops up
          the Ring.

                     FRODO
          Alright!

          late...and Gandalf the Grey rides to
          Isengard seeking my counsel...

The strange tower of Orthanc...hewn from a solid pillar of
black obsidian...rises up in the center of the Isengard
Circle. Gandalf arrives at the foot of the Orthanc Stairs.

                                                            35.



ANGLE ON: SARUMAN, THE WHITE WIZARD

he sweeps down the Orthanc stairs.

                    SARUMAN
          For that is why you have come, is it not,
          my old friend?

Gandalf moves quickly towards him, grimy and weary from his
long ride.

                     GANDALF
          Saruman!

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. ISENGARD GARDENS -- DAY

Gandalf and Saruman walk slowly between the beautiful trees
of Isengard, Saruman's clean, white robe contrasts with
Gandalf's dusty grey robes.

                    SARUMAN
          Are you sure of this?

                    GANDALF
          Beyond any doubt.

                    SARUMAN
          So the ring of power has been found?

                    GANDALF
          All these long years it was in the Shire,
          under my very nose.

                    SARUMAN
          And yet you did not have the wit to see
          it! Your love of the Halfling's leaf has
          clearly slowed your mind.

                    GANDALF
          We still have time...time enough to
          counter Sauron...if we act quickly.

                     SARUMAN
          Time?   What time do you think we have?

                                                        CUT TO:

INT. ORTHANC ANTE-CHAMBER -- DAY

Saruman and Gandalf are seated in a small, cluttered room to
the side of the cavernous central chamber.

CONTINUED:


                    SARUMAN
          Sauron has regained much of his former
          strength. He cannot yet take physical
          form...but his spirit has lost none of
          its potency. Concealed within his
          fortress, the lord of Mordor sees all.
          His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth,
          and flesh. You know of what I speak,
          Gandalf...a great Eye, lidless, wreathed
          in flame.

                    GANDALF
              (softly)
          The eye of Sauron.

                    SARUMAN
          He is gathering all evil to him.

                    SARUMAN (CONT'D)
          Very soon he will have summoned an army
          great enough to launch an assault upon
          Middle earth.

                    GANDALF
          You know this? How?

                    SARUMAN
          I have seen it.

Gandalf and Saruman stride through Orthanc toward a stone
plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth...

                    GANDALF
          A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

Saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the Palantir.

                     SARUMAN
          Why?   Why should we fear to use it?

                    GANDALF
          They are not all accounted for, the lost
          seeing-stones...we do not know who else
          may be watching. Gandalf throws the cloth
          back over the Palantir.

                    SARUMAN
          The hour is later than you think.
          Sauron's forces are already moving...the
          Nine have left Minas Morgul.

                    GANDALF
              (shocked)
          The nine!

                    SARUMAN
          They crossed the river Isen in
          Midsummer's eve, disguised as riders in
          black.

                    GANDALF
              (alarmed)
          They have reached the Shire? Saruman
          shrugs...

                    SARUMAN
          They will find the ring...and kill the
          one who carries it.

Gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door...horrified
as the doors suddenly slam shut.

                    SARUMAN (CONT'D)
          You did not seriously think a Hobbit
          could contend with the will of Sauron?
          There are none who can.

Gandalf slowly turns to Saruman...a look of dawning horror.

                    SARUMAN (CONT'D)
          Against the power of Mordor, there can be
          no victory. We must join with him,
          Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It
          would be wise, my friend.

                    GANDALF
              (deadly)
          Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the
          wise abandon reason for madness?

At that moment: Gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room!
He slams against the wall...pinned there by some unseen
force. With sudden effort, Gandalf wrenches himself off the
wall and swings his staff on Saruman...blasting him off his
feet! Gandalf and Saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing
them across the room. SARUMAN SCREAMS, EYES BLAZING!
Gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp...it
flies across the chamber into Saruman's hand! Gandalf is
flung to the floor.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                    SARUMAN
          I gave you the chance of aiding me
          willingly, but you have elected the way
          of pain.

Gandalf is breathing hard on the floor, his eyes look into
the madness of Saruman... Commanding two staffs, Saruman
sends Gandalf into a sickening spin. Gandalf tumbles towards
the top of the chamber...as if falling in reverse. Rushing
POV: the roof of Orthanc rockets toward camera.

EXT. FARMER'S FIELDS -- DAY

Wide on: Frodo and Sam walking along a country lane which
borders Farmer Maggot's Fields. Sam is looking up...Frodo has
disappeared around a corner in the lane.

                     SAM
               (panicked)
          Mr. Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo turns,
          surprised as Sam comes running towards
          him.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
              (worried)
          I thought I lost you. Frodo looks at Sam
          suspiciously. Sam glances down,
          embarrassed.

                    FRODO
              (teasing)
          What are you talking about?

                    SAM
              (mumbling)
          It's just something Gandalf said...

                    FRODO
          What did he say?

                    SAM
          He said..."Don't you leave him, Samwise
          Gamgee."
              (looks at Frodo intently)
          And I don't mean to.

                    FRODO

SUDDENLY! A figure comes crashing out of a hedgerow sending
Frodo flying. Frodo picks himself up, only to be knocked back
down again by Pippin.

                     PIPPIN
          Frodo!   Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.

                    MERRY
          Hello Frodo

Merry, Pippin, and Frodo picking themselves up... a variety
of vegetables have scattered everywhere.

                    SAM
          What's the meaning of this!

                    MERRY
          Sam, hold this...

Merry gives Sam a large cabbage.

                    SAM
              (accusing)
          You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

A large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them along the
Hedgerow...angry shouts from Farmer Maggot.

                    FARMER MAGGOT    (O.S.)
          Who's that in my field!     Get out of it!
          Get out of my field, you    young varmits!
          I'll show you...get out    of my corn.

Merry and Pippin hurriedly gather their booty and race
away...with Frodo and Sam on their heels.

                    MERRY
              (looking behind him)
          I don't know why he's so upset, it's only
          a couple of carrots.

                    PIPPIN
          And some cabbages...and those three bags
          of potatoes that we lifted last week.
          And then the mushrooms the week before.

                    MERRY
          Yes, Pippin, my point is, he's clearly
          over reacting.

The BAYING OF LARGE DOGS sounds!

Frodo, Sam, and Merry and Pippin tumble head over heels down
a bank, onto a dark, wooded road. CLOSE ON: A winded Pippin,
his face inches away from a large pile of Horse droppings...

                    PIPPIN
          That was close.

Frodo picks himself up and looks around quickly.

                    MERRY
              (groaning)
          Ow...I think I've broken something.

Pulls a LARGE CARROT, almost broken through in the middle,
out from his back pocket.

          Trust a Brandybuck and a Took.

                    MERRY
          What? That was just a detour...a
          shortcut.

                    SAM
          A shortcut to what?

Pippin has spied something under the trees on the far side of
the road.

                     PIPPIN
              (excited)
          Mushrooms!

CLOSE ON: SMALL, brown mushrooms growing amongst the Loamy
undergrowth. Sam, Merry, and Pippin race toward the
mushrooms! Frodo is tense and watchful. He realizes they are
on a wooded road. Scattered leaves rise into the air Whirling
down the road as if blown by an invisible wind...

                                                             41.



SUDDENLY... THE SOUND OF HORSES HOOVES...

                      FRODO
            I think we should get off the road.

A long drawn WAIL comes down the wind, like the cry of some
evil and lonely creature.

                      FRODO (CONT'D)
                (more urgency)
            Get off the road!

Sam grabs Merry and Pippin as the Hobbits quickly scramble
down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. THE SOUND OF HOOVES
is close... A sinister MOUNTED RINGWRATH steps into
view...hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black
horse with insane eyes ! Frodo freezes in terror. The
RINGWRAITH pauses right beside their hiding place...he sits
very still with his head bowed, listening. From inside the
hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an
elusive scent; his head turning from side to side.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

Beads of sweat gather on his brow. The ringwraith suddenly
slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log, peering
suspiciously into the woods.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

He is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling
hands...his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of
some terrible INTERNAL STRUGGLE. The SOUND OF SNIFFING
intensifies as the ringwraith darts his head from side to
side like a bird of party.

CLOSE ON: FRODO SQUEEZING HIS EYES SHUT...

QUICK PSYCHIC BLASTS!   AND EVIL DARK TOWER...A GREAT EYE...A

BURST OF FLAME.

ANGLE ON:   SAM LOOKING AT FRODO WITH CONCERN

                      SAM
            Frodo?

Merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road...the
ringwraith spins around at the sound, and darts to the far
side of the road with frightening speed. Frodo instantly
slumps...as if a PSYCHIC LINK had been broken

Frodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring
lying in the palm of his hand.

EXT. FERRY LANE -- NIGHT

Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin hurry through the
trees...slipping and sliding on the muddy ground.

                      SAM
          Anything?

          Nothing.

Merry moves past pippin, toward Frodo, watching
intently...Sam keeps looking around nervously.

                    MERRY
          The Black rider was looking for
          something...or someone...Frodo?

The SILHOUETTE OF A BLACK RIDER looms against the skyline.
The Four Hobbits... sprawled on the ground, holding their
breath. The BLACK RIDER turns and departs.

          I have to leave the Shire...Sam and I
          must get to Bree.

Merry looks at his friend...realizing Frodo is in deep
trouble.

          Right...Buckleberry Ferry...follow me !

The Hobbits break cover. SUDDENLY, A RINGWRAITH bursts out of
the forest TOWARD THEM!

QUICK ANGLES: STOMPING HOOVES...SNARLING HORSES...

Four RINGWRAITHS are speeding through the Fog...converging on
the FERRY CROSSING. The HOBBITS stampede across the Wharf and
Tumble onto the Ferry.

Frodo races across the Wooden Wharf, followed by the
ringwraiths. He leaps into the Ferry.

CLOSE ON: HOOVES THUNDER DOWN THE WOODEN WHARF!

Sam and Merry shove off with the poles...the ferry slides out
into the river, just as the ringwraiths arrive. They pull up
on the end of the wharf... shrieking with rage! The Hobbits
cover their ears. The Ringwraiths wheel their horses towards
the north and Gallop away along the river bank, quickly
disappearing into the fog.

A SURLY GATEKEEPER glances down at them.

          What do you want?

                    FRODO
          We're headed for the prancing pony.

The gatekeeper swings his lantern onto the hobbits, bathing
them in an uncomfortable yellow spotlight.

                    GATEKEEPER
          Hobbits! Four Hobbits, and what's more,
          out of the Shire by your talk. What
          business brings you to Bree?

                    FRODO
          We wish to stay at the inn...our business

          Gatekeeper unlocks the gate.

                    GATEKEEPER
          All right, young sir, I meant no offense.

The Hobbits gratefully enter Bree...the gatekeeper eyeing
them curiously in the lantern light.

                    GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
          It's my job to ask questions after

INT. "PRANCING PONY" RECEPTION -- NIGHT

Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin come rushing in.   Frodo attracts
the INN KEEPERS'S attention.

                       FRODO
          Excuse me.

                     BUTTERBUR
          Good evening, little masters. If you're
          seeking accommodation, we've got some
          nice, cozy Hobbit sized rooms available,
          Mr...ah...

                    FRODO
          Underhill...my name's Underbill.

                       BUTTERBUR
          Underhill?     Hmmmm.

                    FRODO
          We're friends of Gandalf the Grey...can
          you tell him we've arrived? BUTTERBUR
          frowns...

                    BUTTERBUR
              (Puzzled)
          Gandalf...Gandalf...Oh...
              (recognition)
          Oh yes! I remember...elderly chap...big
          grey beard...pointy hat? Frodo nods with
          relief...Butterbur shakes his head.

                    BUTTERBUR (CONT'D)
          Not seen him for six months. Frodo is
          shocked.

                    SAM
              (worried whisper)
          What do we do now?

INT. PRANCING PONY INN -- NIGHT

Wide on: the noise, smokey Inn. It is dimly lit, cheifly
from a blazing log fire...and crowded with a mixture of BIG
FOLK, LOCAL HOBBITS, and a couple of dwarfs. Frodo, Sam,
Merry and Pippin are sitting at a table against the wall...
clearly trying to remain Quiet and inconspicuous... Sam can't
help himself...he keeps casting nervous glances around.

                    FRODO
          Sam, he'll be here.    He'll come.

Merry ploinks himself down at a table, carrying a very large
mug of beer.

                    PIPPIN
          What's that?

                    MERRY
          This, my friend, is a pint.

                    PIPPIN
          It comes in pints?    I'm getting one!

Sam watches Pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to
the bar.

                    SAM
          You've had a whole half already. Merry
          watches Pippin go.

A COUPLE OF SWARTHY MEN leaning against the bar glance at
Frodo, then quickly look away.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
              (tense)
          That fellow's done nothing but stare at
          you since we've arrived.

Sam indicates a BROODING STRANGER who sits alone at a table
in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed
pipe, peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with
gleaming eyes. Frodo gestures to Butterbur...

                    FRODO
          Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is
          he?

                    BUTTERBUR
          He's one of them Rangers; they're
          dangerous folk they are, wandering the
          wilds. What his right name is, I never
          heard, but round here he's known as
          Strider.

                    FRODO
              (to himself)
          Strider.

BENEATH TABLE: FRODO'S fingers are nervously TOYING WITH THE
RING.

                                                            47.



CLOSE ON: FRODO

Sweat runs down his brow.   The Strange hum of the Ring spills
into the Soundtrack.

"Baggins...Baggins..." a creepy whisper seems to fill Frodo's
head...sound that dissolves into Pippin's loud voice:

                    PIPPIN
          Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins...he's
          over there...

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN

sitting at the bar, chatting with Locals.   Frodo leaps to his
feet and pushes his way towards the bar.

                    PIPPIN
              (loudly)
          Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin
          once removed, on his mother's side and my
          third cousin twice removed on his
          father's side...if you follow me.

Frodo grabs Pippin's sleeve, spilling his beer.

                    FRODO
          Pippin!

                    PIPPIN
          Steady on, Frodo!

Pippin pushes Frodo away...he stumbles backwards, and falls
to the floor. At that instant, the Inn goes silent and all
the attention turns to Frodo...

                                                      CLOSE ON:

The ring...in agonizing Slow motion we watch as it seems to
hang in the air for a split second...then crashes down onto
his out stretched finger. FRODO VANISHES! There is a sharp
intake of breath...followed by total silence.

INT. "PRANCING PONY" INN -- NIGHT

Sam looks sick; Pippin instantly sobers, realizing his folly;
the brooding stranger frowns...and the inn erupts into
excited babble.

                                        IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:

FRODO: as he finds himself in the TWILIGHT WORLD of the ring:
THE EXCITED CROWD ARE suddenly moving in slow
motion...distorted voices...a weird photographic negative
quality. FRODO is moving in real time; against the slow
motion background. He suddenly clutches his head as he is
hit with quick images...of a GREAT EYE! AN EVIL CAT-LIKE
EYE, wreathed in flames.

VOICE OF SAURON

There is no life here in the void...only cold...only death...
FRODO is terrified! He rolls under a table, desperately
pulling the ring from his finger. FRODO MATERIALIZES into the
real world. AT THAT MOMENT: A LARGE HAND reaches under the
table and Grabs Frodo by the collar, and DRAGS HIM AWAY!

                    STRIDER
          A little more caution from you...that is
          no trinket you carry.

                    FRODO
          I carry nothing.

                    STRIDER
          Indeed? I can usually avoid being seen
          if I wish, but to disappear entirely...
          that is a rare gift.

                    FRODO
          Who are you?

                    STRIDER
          Are you frightened?

          Yes.

                    STRIDER
          Not nearly frightened enough. I know
          what hunts you. Frodo jumps at the sound
          of a noise in the corridor. Strider
          deftly draws his sword.

The door bursts open and Sam, Merry and Pippin appear on the
doorway. Sam is Squaring off with is fists, Merry brandishes
a candlestick, and Pippin a chair.

          Let him go or I'll have you, Longshanks!

STRIDER SHEATHS his sword, a slight smile playing on his
lips.

          You have a stout heart, little Hobbit,
          but that alone won't save you...You can

          Great Kings of men. Then Sauron the
          deceiver gave to them Nine Rings of
          Power. Blinded by their greed they took
          them without question, one by one falling
          into darkness and now they are slaves to
          his will.

Strider looks from the window as the Ringwraiths gallop down
the Bree Streets. CLOSE ON: Strider turns back to the
Hobbits, his face lit faintly by the Glowing Embers of the
Fire.

          They are the Nazgul, Ringwraiths, neither

          power of the one..they will never stop

Strider stares at Pippin blankly, then turns away, shaking
his head.

                    SARUMAN
          There are for you. Keep them close. I'm
          going to have a look around. Stay here.

EXT. WEATHERTOP HOLLOW -- NIGHT

Close on: Frodo...eyes flickering open. He suddenly sits up,
sniffing the air. Sam, Merry, and Pippin huddled over a small
fire... Sausages and bacon sizzle in a hot frying pan.

                    FRODO
          What are you doing?

                    MERRY
          Tomatoes, sausages, and crispy bacon.

          We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.

                    FRODO
          Put it out, you fools! Put it out! Frodo
          desperately kicks dirt on the fire!

                    PIPPIN
          Oh, that's nice...ash on my tomatoes!

A SUDDEN SHREIK!

                                                       ANGLE ON:

FIVE RINGWRAITHS ON FOOT, running up the steep slope
unnaturally fast.

                    FRODO
          Go! !

Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin clamber desperately towards the
summit, clutching their swords.

EXT. WEATHERTOP SUMMIT -- NIGHT

Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin race into a RING OF BROKEN
STONES on the summit or Weathertop...the ruined base of an
ancient tower. The hobbits stand back-to-back in the centre
of the Ring, waiting for the first assault... One by one, the
5 Ringwraiths appear...brandishing Gleaming swords, they move
slowly towards the hobbits. In the center is their
leader...the WITCH KING!

                    SAM
          Back, you devils!

Sam rushes forward with a cry. He swings his sword at the
Witch King, who blocks the blow with his own sword. Sam's
blade shatters...the WITCH KING lashes out with his fist,
sending Sam flying. Merry and Pippin, overcome with terror,
throw themselves flat on the ground. THE RINGWRAITHS close in
on Frodo...a Venomous whisper dances in his head...

Frodo shuts his eyes and staggers back, desperately resisting
the WRAITH'S WHISPERINGS... slow motion as his hand goes into
his pocket and pulls out the ring. The 5 Ringwraiths utter a
chilling SCREECH OF EXCITEMENT. Frodo is unable to resist any
longer, falls to his knees and slips on the ring. He
disappears.

                                                     ANGLE ON:

Frodo finds himself in the weird twilight world...he looks
upon the Ringwraiths, now visible in their TRUE APPEARANCE:
Five Ghouls dressed in long Grey robes, with white hair, and
Pallid, ruthless faces. THE WITCH KING extends a haggard hand
towards Frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger. Frodo's
trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the
ring...he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away.
The witch king snarls and springs forward. He stabs at Frodo
with a wicked dagger! Frodo winces as the tip of the dagger
sinks into his shoulder. Suddenly, Strider charges at the
RINGWRAITHS, wielding his sword in one hand, a flaming torch
in the other. He moves in slow motion, visible through a sea
of mist. Frodo sinks to the ground. Behind him is a faint
image of a Ringwraith fleeing, his head engulfed in flames.
With draining strength, Frodo manages to pull the ring off
his finger...

                                           IN THE REAL WORLD:

...Appearing back in the real world, Sam rushes over to him.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
              (horrified)
          Frodo!

Another Ringwraith is burning and screaming...others screech
fearfully at the flames, turn and flee form the Weathertop
summit.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
              (panicked)
          Mr. Frodo!!

Strider kneels before Frodo. He snatches up the Witch King's
Dagger from the ground, staring gravely at the long, thin,
blade.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
          Help him, Strider!

                     STRIDER
              (grim)
          He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade. The
          Morgul Blade suddenly melts...vanishing
          into the air like smoke. Strider throws
          the hilt down in disgust...

          This is beyond my skill to heal.
              (urgently)
          He needs Elvish medicine. Strider lifts
          Frodo onto his shoulders.

EXT. WEATHERHILLS -- NIGHT

Strider is jogging grimly, carrying an ailing Frodo on his
back. Sam, Merry, and Pippin are running to keep up. The
hobbits are carrying Flaming torches for protection.

                    STRIDER
          Hurry!

                    SAM
          We are six days from Rivendell. Frodo
          groans.

                    STRIDER
          Hold on, Frodo.

                     SAM
          He'll never make it! Close on:
          Frodo...head lolling about, barely

          Gandalf...Gandalf?

EXT. ISENGARD -- NIGHT

Low angle...looking up at ORTHANC...the tower of Isengard,
gleaming in the moonlight. The camera rises to reveal the
once beautiful gardens are not a pitted wasteland...with
smoke and fire billowing out

of numerous tunnels and vent holes that litter the forecourt
of ORTHANC. Strange guttural chants echo up from deep
underground. The camera is rising...a small moth flutters
into shot...and leads the camera towards the summit or
Orthanc. Gandalf lies slumped against the wall at the very
top of Orthanc, surrounded by a sheer 500 foot drop. He
looks Weak and Frail...and is seemingly asleep. The MOTH
flutters close to Gandalf. His hand suddenly moves at
lighting speed and SNATCHES THE MOTH. Gandalf brings his hand
close to his face and opens it. The moth sits on the palm of
his hand as Gandalf mutter strange words in a foreign tongue.
Close on: THE MOTH'S face... seemingly listening.

tunnel!

INT. CAVERNS BELOW ISENGARD -- NIGHT

The dead trees of Isengard are fed into roaring
furnaces...molten metal pours into casts...red hot metal,
beaten my sweating orc blacksmiths...armor and weapons are
forged from the great furnaces. Saruman strides among the
ORCS and stands looking on a new born uruk-hai as it escapes
its birthing membrane...this is LURTZ, who rises up to stand
before his master.

          Is he going to die? Frodo's breathing is
          getting shallow. Strider looks out into
          the darkness.

                    STRIDER
          No. He is passing into the shadow world,
          he will soon become a wraith like them.

A DISTANT CRY of a RINGWRAITH carries through the air.

                    MERRY

Without hesitation, the white horse leaps into the shallow
water and thunders across the Ford. The 9 Ringwraiths pull up
short of the Ford, clearly nervous of the water. The white
horse reaches the other side...Arwen pulls up and turns to
defiantly face the Ringwraiths from across the Ford.

                    WITCH KING
          Give up the Halfling, she-elf! She draws

Frodo looks up weakly...to see a vast torrent of Water
flooding down the river towards the ford...as if a dam had
burst! The Foaming water seems to form the shape of Dancing
white horses with frothing manes! The Ringwraiths scream in
terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge. Their Piercing

          some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.

Frodo sits up, looking at Gandalf questioningly...

                    FRODO
          What happened, Gandalf?    Why didn't you
          meet us?

                    GANDALF
          I'm sorry Frodo.

Close on: Gandalf... troubled.   His eyes drift away.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          I was delayed.

EXT. ORTHANC SUMMIT -- NIGHT

SARUMAN stands over Gandalf, gloating...

                    SARUMAN
          Get up! So much for the power of the
          Ring or embrace your own destruction!

With the power of his staff, Saruman raises Gandalf from the
ground, then sends him crashing to the floor.

                    GANDALF
          There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only
          one who can bend it to his will...and he
          does not share power.

SUDDENLY! GANDALF lurches to his feet and Throws himself off
the Tower! Saruman watches Gandalf fly away from
Isengard...on the Back of a GIANT EAGLE.

                    SARUMAN

          So you have chosen death!

Frodo raises himself up and looks at Gandalf.

                    FRODO
          Gandalf! What is it? Gandalf returns his
          attention to Frodo.

                    GANDALF
          Nothing, Frodo...

Sam runs to Frodo's bedside.   He is overjoyed to find Frodo
awake.

                     SAM
          Frodo!   Frodo!   Bless you, you're awake!!

                    GANDALF
          Sam has hardly left your side.

                    SAM
          We were worried about you--weren't we,
          Mr. Gandalf?

                    GANDALF
          By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're
          beginning to mend. ELROND, LORD OF THE
          HIGH ELVES, steps up to Frodo's

bedside...his face is neither old nor young, though in it is
written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful.

                    ELROND
          Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.
          Frodo sits up, looking at Elrond with
          awe.

          of Imladris have dwelt within this valley
          for three thousand years through few of
          my kin now remain. Frodo looks out from
          his balcony.

their arms around him.

                     MERRY
          Frodo!   Frodo!

Sam looks past Frodo smiling... a bent figure sits alone on a
bench, in the Sun. Close on: Frodo turning, following Sam's

          Hello, Frodo, my lad!

                     FRODO
          Bilbo!

LATER... Frodo is turning the neatly inscribed title page of
a red leather bound journal:

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
              (reading)
          "There and back again: A Hobbit's tale"

Bilbo smiles Proudly. He is sitting with Frodo on a terrace
overlooking a Waterfall. Frodo looks at Page after page of
beautiful Handwriting, with intricate Maps and Drawings.

          I meant to go back...wander the paths of
          Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the Lonely
          Mountain again...but age, it seems, has
          finally caught up with me.

Frodo turns a page...there before him, is a map of the Shire.

                    FRODO
              (quietly)
          I miss the Shire...I spent all my

          else...off with you, on one of your
          adventures...
              (Looks at Bilbo)
          But my own adventure, turned out to be
          quite different...I'm not like you,
          Bilbo.

Sam busily tries to stuff more and more things into his

          No, what have I forgotten? Pull back to
          reveal Frodo, hands in his pocket,
          watching Sam.

                    FRODO
          Packed already?

Sam looks up, startled.

                    SAM
              (slightly embarrassed)
          No harm in being prepared. Frodo strolls
          to the edge of the Balcony.

                    SAM
          I did. It's just...we did what Gandalf
          wanted, didn't we? We got the Ring this
          far, to Rivendell...and I thought...
          seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be
          off soon. Off home.

          You're right, Sam. Frodo looks at Sam...

          ...we did what we set out to do. Frodo
          opens his hand, the Ring sits in his
          Palm.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)

          His strength returns.

                    GANDALF
          That wound will never fully heal. He will
          carry it the rest of his life.

                    ELROND
          And yet to have come so far still bearing
          the Ring...the hobbit has shown
          extraordinary resilience to its evil.

                    GANDALF
          It is a burden he should never have to
          had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.

                    ELROND
          Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's
          forces are massing in the east. His eye
          is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you
          tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of
          allies grows thin.

          His treachery runs deeper than you know.
          By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc
          with Goblin Men...he is breeding an army
          in the caverns of Isengard. An army that
          can move in Sunlight and cover great
          distance at speed. Saruman is coming for
          the Ring.

Elrond turns and walks away...

                    ELROND
          This evil cannot be concealed by the
          power of the Elves...We do not have the
          strength to fight both Mordor and
          Isengard...Gandalf...the ring cannot stay
          here.

Gandalf turns and looks out the window.

Sounds of arrivals...Gandalf watches as Boromir rides through
Rivendell gate, followed by Legolas and Gimli.

                    ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          This peril belongs to all Middle earth.
          They must decide how to end it. Not just
          for themselves but for those who come
          after. Elrond approaches Gandalf.

                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          The time of the Elves is over. My people
          are leaving these shores. Who will you
          look to when we have gone? The dwarves?
          They hide in their mountains seeking
          riches. They care nothing for the
          troubles of others.

                    GANDALF
          It is in Men that we must place our hope.

                    ELROND
          Men? Men are weak.      The race of Men is
          failing. The blood     of Numenor is all but
          spent, its pride and    dignity forgotten.
          It is because of men    the Ring survives.

FLASH INSERT: With the broken sword, Isildur slices off
Sauron's finger. Elrond reacts.

                    ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          I was there, Gandalf...I was there three
          thousand years ago when Isildur took the
          ring.

             It should have ended that day, but evil
             was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the
             Ring...and the line of Kings was broken.
             There's no strength left in the world of

Arwen closes Strider's fingers around the jewel.

Arwen leans towards Strider, gently kissing him.

INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER, RIVENDELL -- DAY

Elrond addresses the council...

                    ELROND
          Strangers from distant lands ... friends
          of old. You have been summoned here to
          answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-earth
          stands upon the brink of destruction.
          None can escape it. You will unite...or
          you will fall. Each race is bound to this
          fate...this one doom...

Frodo sits amongst a council of free-peoples of Middle earth,
Elrond stands before them, addressing Gandalf, Strider,
Legolas, and 20 other elves, Dwarves, and men.

                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

Frodo steps forward and moves towards a stone Plinth. He
places the ring on the plinth and returns to his seat.

                    BOROMIR
              (shocked)
          So it is true!

                    LEGOLAS
              (disbelief)
          Sauron's Ring! The ring of power!

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            74.

                     GIMLI
              (grim)
          The doom of man!

                    BOROMIR
          It is a gift...a gift to the foes of
          Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has
          my father, the Steward of Gondor, held
          the forces of Mordor at bay...by the
          blood of our people are your lands kept
          safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the
          enemy...let us use it against him!

                    STRIDER
          You cannot wield it. None of us can.
          The one ring answers to Sauron alone...it
          has no other master. Boromir turns and
          looks at Strider, coolly.

                    BOROMIR
          And what would a ranger know of this
          matter?

Strider says nothing and Boromir turns away dismissively.
LEGOLAS stands...

                    LEGOLAS
          This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn,
          son of Arathorn. You owe him your
          allegiance.

Frodo looks at Strider questioningly...Boromir turns sharply.

                    BOROMIR
              (quiet disbelief)
          Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?

                    LEGOLAS
          And heir to the throne of Gondor.

                    ARAGORN
              (Elvish: with subtitles)
          Havo dad, Legolas...Sit down, Legolas..

                    BOROMIR
          Gondor needs no king.

                    GANDALF
          Aragorn is right...we cannot use it.

                    ELROND
          You have only one choice..the ring must
          be destroyed.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

The HUM OF THE RING seems to grow louder in Frodo's ears.
Gimli suddenly stands, excited.

                    GIMLI
          Then...what are we waiting for?

Gimli suddenly rushes forward! He swings his axe down on the
ring. The axe shatters with a deafening crack! Gimli falls
backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring...unharmed! Frodo
winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him! He slumps
in this chair, clutching his forehead. Gandalf looks at him
with concern.

                    ELROND
          The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son
          of Gloin, by any craft that we

                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          here possess. The ring was made in the
          fires of Mount Doom...only there can it
          be unmade. It must be taken deep into
          Mordor, and cast back into the fiery
          chasm from whence it came. One of you
          must do this.

Stunned silence...the council sits with downcast eyes, as if
a great dread has descended on them. Boromir addresses the
council in a quiet voice

                    BOROMIR
          One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its
          black gates are guarded by more than just
          Orcs. There is evil there that does not
          sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful.
          It is a barren wasteland, riddled with
          fire and ash and dust...the very air you
          breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with
          ten thousand men could you do this. It
          is folly.

                    LEGOLAS
          Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has
          said? The ring must be destroyed.

                    GIMLI
          And I suppose you think you're the one to
          do it?

                    BOROMIR
          And if we fail, what then? What happens
          when Sauron takes back what is his?

Gimli leaps to his feet!

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                    GIMLI
          I will be dead before I see the Ring in
          the hands of an Elf! A STORM OF ARGUMENT
          erupts around the room. CLOSE ON:
          FRODO...sound disappears as he watches in
          slow

motion...the angry faces, the shaking fists, the accusatory
fingers, his eyes move across to the ring...the hum grows
louder in his head.

                    GIMLI (CONT'D)
              (shouting)
          Never trust an Elf!

CLOSE ON: THE RING fills the screen...streams of blood flow
across the surface... flames flicker within the Gold Band.

                    GANDALF
          Do you not understand? While we    bicker
          among ourselves, Sauron's power   grows!
          No one will escape it. You will   all be
          destroyed, your homes burnt and   your
          families put to the sword!

CLOSE ON: FRODO...breathing rapidly, Caught in the grip of
his hideous vision. With a huge effort or will, Frodo tears
his gaze upon the ring. Frodo suddenly stands...he speaks in
a strong, clear voice.

                    FRODO
          I will take it...I will take it...I will
          take the Ring to Mordor.

Sudden silence...Frodo looks around the room at the astounded
faces.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
              (quietly)
          Though...I do not know the way. Gandalf
          rises to his feet.

                    GANDALF
          I will help you bear this burden, Frodo
          Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.

                    ARAGORN
          If, by my life or death, I can protect
          you, I will.
              (kneels before Frodo)
          ...you have my sword. Aragorn steps
          forward...followed by Legolas and Gimli.

          And my axe.

Boromir looks at them all then walks towards Frodo.

                    BOROMIR
          You carry the fate of us all, little one.

Boromir looks towards Elrond and Gandalf.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          If this is indeed the will of the
          Council, then Gondor will see it done.

Frodo stares in wonder as the Greatest Fighters in all Middle
earth stand at his side.

                    SAM
              (unseen)
          Here!

A Sudden Noise...Sam pops up from behind a Bush!

                    SAM (CONT'D)
          Mr. Frodo's not gong anywhere without me.

                    ELROND
          No, Indeed...it is hardly possible to
          separate you...even when he is summoned
          to a secret council and you are not.

Merry and Pippin jump up from behind another bush!

                    MERRY
          Oi! We're coming too! You'll have to
          send us home tied up in a sack to stop
          us.

                    PIPPIN
          Anyway...you need people of intelligence
          on this sort of
          mission...quest...thing...

                    MERRY
          Well, that rules you out, Pip.

Scabbard...its polished, well tendered Blade glitters cold

          My old sword "Sting"...here, take it!

Bilbo offers Sting to Frodo.

                    FRODO
          It's so light!

                    BILBO
          Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know.
          The blade glows blue when Orcs are
          close...and it's times like that, my lad,
          when you have to be extra careful.

Bilbo unwraps a small shirt of close woven Mail.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Here's a pretty thing. Mithril, as light
          as a feather, and as hard as dragon
          scales. Let me see you put it on. Come
          on.

CLOSE ON: Frodo peels off his shirt... revealing The Ring on
the Chain around his neck.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (entranced)
          Oh! My old Ring... Frodo frowns as Bilbo
          moves toward him.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I should very much like to hold it again,
          one last time. Bilbo reaches forward,
          eyes locked on the ring.

CONTINUED:


Suddenly! A shadow passes across Bilbo...for a split second
he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and Bony,
groping hands. Frodo pulls away, shocked...the shadow passes.
Bilbo slumps into a chair, his head in his hands. Bilbo
falters...his eyes filling with tears.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Oh!

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (sad)
          I'm sorry, that I brought this upon you,
          my boy...I'm sorry that you must carry
          this burden. I'm sorry for everything.

Bilbo sobs and Frodo moves to comfort him.

turbulent waters...the misty mountains rise sharply to their
left.

          We must hold to his course west of the
          misty Mountains for forty days. If our
          luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still
          be open to us. From there, our road
          turns east, to Mordor.

          Thanks.

CLOSE ON: GIMLI has managed to corner Gandalf....

                    GIMLI
          If anyone were to ask for my opinion,
          which I note they have not, I would say
          we are taking the long way round.
          Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of
          Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a
          royal welcome. Gandalf clearly thinks
          that is a bad idea.

                    GANDALF
          No, Gimli. I would not take the road
          through Moria unless I had no other
          choice.

Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand. Pippin throws
down his sword, kicks and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to
the ground. Much laughter. Legolas' eyes are fixed on a
distant Dark Patch which darts about the sky, like flying
smoke in the wind.

                    SAM
          What is that?

                    GIMLI

Great speed, wheeling and circling above. As their dark
shadow passes over the fellowship, a single harsh croak is
heard...and the crows suddenly wheel away, back towards the

          Spies of Saruman.    The passage South is

Gandalf looks at Aragorn, turns to the others...gesturing

The Fellowship clamber through Rock and Snow. CLOSE ON: Frodo
slips on some shale...as he scrambles to his feet, the Ring
falls on the ground... CLOSE ON: the ring gleaming in the
snow! Boromir's Hand picks it up by the chain...he stands,
the ring dangling before his eyes. He seems to grow in
stature, as if absorbing its power. Aragorn warily approaches
Boromir...Boromir is motionless...he stares at the ring, as
if transfixed.

                     ARAGORN
          Boromir?

          It is a strange fate that we should

          Caradhras. And if that fails...where
          then will you go? THE FELLOWSHIP
          struggles through the snow.

                    SARUMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          If the mountain defeats you, will you
          risk a more dangerous road?

EXT. PASS OF CARADHRAS -- DAY

THE FELLOWSHIP are struggling through a blinding blizzard, up
towards the PASS OF CARADHRAS. Legolas the Elf moves lightly
across the top of the snow...he suddenly pauses. Saruman's
voice sweeps by in the wind.

                    LEGOLAS
              (urgent)
          There is a fell voice in the air.

                    GANDALF
          It's Saruman.

THUNDER RUMBLES...ROCK and Shale fall from above.

                    ARAGORN
              (urgently)
          He's trying to bring down the mountain.
          Gandalf! We must turn back!

                       GANDALF
          No!

GANDALF RAISES HIS STAFF...HE CHANTS INTO THE WIND.

                    GANDALF
              (YELLING)
          Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho I
          ruith. Sleep Caradhras, be still, lie
          still, hold your wrath.

EXT. ISENGARD -- DAY

CAMERA SWEEPS PAST SARUMAN...he stands on the summit of
Orthanc, Chanting. CLOUDS ARE FLOWING FROM ALL DIRECTIONS...
converging on the distant mountains in a stormy Malestrom.

EXT. PASS OF CARADHRAS -- DAY

Saruman's voice strengthens...rolling past the fellowship
like thunder. A LIGHTNING CRACK explodes on the mountainside
above them. Frodo looks up in horror as a huge snow avalanche
thunders down towards them! The Fellowship throw themselves
against the cliff face as snow crashes onto the narrow ledge.
LEGOLAS pulls Gandalf to safety. Aragorn shields Frodo and
Sam as snow piles around them. Within moments, the pass is
blocked and the fellowship are enveloped in snow. Boromir
and Aragorn frantically dig for the hobbits...who are pulled
out Shivering and Fearful.

                    BOROMIR
              (urgent)
          We must get off the mountain! Make for
          the gap of Rohan and take the West road
          to my city.

                    ARAGORN
          The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to
          Isengard.

                    GIMLI
          We cannot pass over the mountain. Let us
          go under it. Let us go through the mines
          of Moria. Gandalf has a concerned look on
          his face.

          Moria. You fear to go into those mines,
          don't you? The dwarves delved too
          greedily and too deep.

                    SARUMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          You know what they awoke in, the darkness
          of Khazad-dum. Shadow and flame.

                    GANDALF
          Let the ringbearer decide.

CLOSE ON: FRODO, the weight of the decision weighing heavily
upon him. CLOSE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN shivering in Boromir's
arms.

                      GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Frodo?

Frodo meets Gandalf's eye.

                    FRODO
          We will go through the mines. Gandalf
          slowly nods.

                      GANDALF
          So be it.

EXT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

The Fellowship are walking along the far shore of dark
lake...directly below great looming cliffs.

                    GIMLI
              (in awe)
          The walls of Moria!

Footing is treacherous on the narrow strip of green and
greasy stones. Gandalf touches the smooth rock wall between
the trees... slowly, faint lines appear like slender veins of
luminous silver running through the stone.

                     GANDALF
          Itidin...it mirrors only starlight and
          moonlight.

A large moon rises over the mountains... The lines grow
Broader and Clearer, forming a glowing arch of interlacing
ancient letters and symbols.

          It reads, "The door of Durin, Lord of
          Moria. Speak, friend, and enter."

                    MERRY
          What do you suppose that means?

                    GANDALF
              (confident)
          It's quite simple. If you are a friend,
          speak the password and the doors will
          open.

Gandalf raises his arms...

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
              (incanting)
          Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!

The cliff towers into the night, the wind blows cold, Frodo
shivers... and the door stands fast!

                                                         LATER:

GANDALF CONTINUES...

Mumbling spells in his efforts to open the door. Sam packs
pots and pans at his feet...watching sadly as Aragorn un-
saddles Bill the pony. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN whispering to Bill
the Pony.

                    ARAGORN
              (whispering)
          Mines are no place for a Pony, even one
          so brave as Bill.

                       SAM
          Bye, Bill.

                    ARAGORN
          Go on, Bill, go on..don't worry, Sam...he
          knows his way home. Aragorn slaps Bill on
          the rump...Bill goes trotting off. CLOSE
          ON: Sam watching Bill disappear into the
          darkness.

                    SAM
          Goodbye, Bill.

SPLASH! Merry and Pippin are tossing stones into the lake.
Black Rippling rings slowly fan out. Pippin is about to
throw another stone, but Aragorn grabs his arm.

                    ARAGORN
              (ominous)
          Do not disturb the water.

Aragorn watches anxiously as the Ripples appear to grow....he
exchanges a look with Boromir.

Aragorn's hand creeps towards his sword. Gandalf gives up in
despair...he sits down beside Frodo. Close on: Frodo peers at
the Elvish inscription...his face breaks into a smile of
comprehension.

                    FRODO
              (quietly)
          It's a riddle...

Gandalf raises his eyebrows...

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
              (explaining)
          Speak, friend, and enter.   What's the
          Elvish for friend?

                    GANDALF
          Oh...mellon.

With that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and
two great Doors swing outwards... revealing a blackness
deeper than the night. As the Fellowship enter the Blackness,
something in the water stirs....

INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

The Fellowship step warily into the darkness of Moria...a
Dank cavern, with winding steps leading deeper into the
mountain.

                    GIMLI
          So, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled
          hospitality of the dwarves; roaring
          fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone.
          This, my friend, is the home of my
          cousin, Balin...and they call this a
          Mine...
              (snorting)
          A mine!

A Glow from Gandalf's Staff suddenly lights    the chamber...
The Fellowship recoil in Horror! Many dwarf    Skeletons are
strewn about, clearly the dead of some old    battle...the
rusting armor and shields are peppered with    arrows and axes.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                    BOROMIR

          This is no mine...it's a tomb!

                    GIMLI
              (in horror)
          Oh...no...no..no... ! Legolas pulls a
          crude arrow out of a skeleton.

                     LEGOLAS
          Goblins!

The Fellowship draw swords and back away, towards the
Entrance.

                    BOROMIR
          We make for the Gap of Rohan.    We should
          never have come here.

EXT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

Frodo is suddenly PULLED TO THE GROUND. A long sinuous
Tentacle is wrapped around Frodo's ankle and is dragging him
towards the lake. FRODO CRIES OUT as Aragorn and Boromir rush
forward! Aragorn severs the Tentacle holding Frodo, and pulls
him to safety...Boromir hacks at the other Writhing Limbs. 20
more tentacles ripple out of the Lake! The dark water Boils
as the hideous beast lashes out at the FELLOWSHIP! Again the
creature grabs Frodo and pulls him to the lake, Frodo is
flung in the air as the Fellowship battle the creature.
Aragorn hacks at a tentacle...Frodo is released, falling into
Boromir's arms.

                    GANDALF
          Into the mines!

                     BOROMIR
          Legolas!

Legolas shoots an Arrow into the creature's head, gaining a
few vital seconds for Aragorn and Boromir as they race out of
the water with Frodo. The FELLOWSHIP hurriedly back away from
the Creature... retreating into the Moria Chamber as many
Coiling arms seize the large doors.

INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away,
creating a rock slide that crashes down the Cliff Face.
Within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway... throwing the
Fellowship into Pitch Blackness.

A faint light rises from Gandalf's staff, throwing a Creepy
Glow across the old wizards face.

                    GANDALF
              (ominous)
          We now have but one choice...we must face
          the long dark of Moria. Be on your
          guard...there are older and fouler things
          than the Orcs in the deep places of the
          world.

WIDE ON: the Fellowship crossing a precarious bridge above
deep mine workings.

                    GANDALF
          Quietly, now. It's a four day journey to
          the other side. Let us hope that our
          presence will go unnoticed.

INT. MORIA CEMETERY CAVERN -- NIGHT

They continue up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf
cemetery. The graves are despoiled...dwarf skeletons are
strewn about and Goblin Graffiti is scrawled on monuments in
dried Dwarf blood. The Atmosphere is very sinister.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. MORIA TUNNEL FORK -- NIGHT

The path splits into three passages...each disappearing into
dark tunnels. Gandalf pauses, frowning.

                    GANDALF
          I have no memory of this place.

LATER... The Fellowship are nervously waiting...while Gandalf
sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of
him. He appears to be in some kind of trance.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

He turns at the sound of a faint noise down the tunnel behind
them.

                    PIPPIN

          Merry!

                    MERRY
          What?

                    PIPPIN
          I'm hungry.

Frodo's POV: a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the
darkness. Frodo is nervous...he approaches Gandalf.

                    FRO DO
              (whispers)
          There's something down there.

                    GANDALF
              (quietly)
          It's Gollum.

                    FRODO
          Gollum!

                    GANDALF
          He's been following us for three days.

TEASING SHOT: and emaciated, leering creature.

                    FRODO
              (disbelieving)
          He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?

                    GANDALF
          Escaped...or was set loose. And now the
          Ring has drawn him here...he will never
          be rid of his need for it. He hates and
          loves the ring, as he hates and loves
          himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story.
          Gandalf catches Frodo's look of surprise.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Yes...Smeagol he was once called...Before
          the ring came to him, before it drove him
          mad.

Gollum's withered fingers are gripping the cave wall...he is
large, Luminous eyes blinking with malice.

                    FRODO
             (grim)
         It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he
         had the chance.

                   GANDALF
         Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's
         hand. Many that live deserve death, and
         some that die deserve life. Can you give
         it to them, Frodo? Frodo frowns.

                   GANDALF (CONT'D)
         Do not be too eager to deal out death in
         judgment...even the very wise cannot see
         all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum
         has some part to play yet, for good or
         ill, before this is over. The pity of
         Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

                   FRODO
         I wish the ring had never come to me...I
         wish none of this had happened.

                   GANDALF
         So do all who live to see such times, but
         that is not for them to decide. All we
         have to decide is what to do with the
         time that is given to us. There is a note
         of finality in Gandalf's voice.

                   GANDALF (CONT'D)
         There are other forces at work in this
         world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
         Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In
         which case, you also were meant to have
         it...and that is an encouraging thought,
             (sudden brightness)
         Ah! That it's that way! Gandalf points
         at the right hand tunnel...the Fellowship
         scramble to their feet.

                   MERRY
             (relieved)
         He's remembered!

                   GANDALF
         No, but the air doesn't smell so foul
         down there. If in doubt, Meriadoc,
         always follow your nose!
             (laughs)
         Ye s...

INT. DWAROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA -- DAY

The Fellowship pass under an arched doorway into a black and
empty space. Gandalf pauses...

                    GALADRIEL
          Let me risk a little more light. Gandalf
          taps his staff...for a brief moment a
          light

blazes... like a silent Flash of Lightning.    Great shadows
spring up and flee...

                    GANDALF
          Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city
          of Dwarrowdelf! Frodo gasps at the brief
          sight of a vast roof, far above

their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone.
Before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls,
polished and smooth as glass.

                    SAM
          Well, there's an eye opener and no
          mistake!

Ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. Black arrows
are embedded in the timbers. Two goblin skeletons lie in the
doorway. Gimli rushes ahead...

                    GANDALF
          Gimli!!

INT. BALIN'S TOMB, MORIA -- DAY

Gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber... lit with a
narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near
the roof. Dwarf and Goblin skeletons are piled high. In the
far corner sits a stone walled Well. A shaft of light falls
directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room: a
single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great
slab of white stone. Gimli falls to his knees...

                    GIMLI
          No...no...oh, no!

Gimli sobs.

Gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto
the white stone slab.

            Moria." He is dead, then. It's as I had
            feared.

Gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from
the white stone slab. It has been slashed and stabbed...and

            We must move on, we cannot linger.

            "They have taken the Bridge and the
            second hall: we have barred the
            gates...but cannot hold them for
            long...the ground shakes...drums in the
            deep...we cannot get out. A shadow moves
            in the dark. Will no- one save us? They
            are coming."

Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously...He stumbles against
the well, sending a precariously balanced Armored skeleton
tumbling in! Merry reaches out, Grabbing hold of Pippin
before he falls. The Fellowship freeze in stunned silence as
the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well...echoing
loudly!

INT. MORIA CAVERNS -- DAY

Gandalf turns angrily on Pippin.

                      GANDALF
                (angry)
            Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next
            time and rid us of your stupidity!

ANGLE ON:    PIPPIN, CHASTENED.

They fall silent. A low rolling boom rises from the depths
below...growing louder...BOOM...BOOM...as if the caverns of
Moria were turned into a vast drum. A great horn blasts
nearby...Answering horns ... running feet...harsh cries...
Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt...

                       SAM
                (worried)

Frodo looks down. A cold blue glow is emanating from Sting's
Scabbard! Frodo draws the Sword...and stares at its glowing
blade!

                     LEGOLAS
          Orcs !

                    ARAGORN
              (to the hobbits)
          Get back! Stay close to Gandalf.

Aragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors. Boromir
catches sight of something; he turns to Aragorn with shock in
his eyes.

                    BOROMIR
          They have a cave troll!

Gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the
tomb.

                    GIMLI
              (yelling)
          Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in
          Moria who still draws breath!

BOOM! The Door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments,
and 20 Goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave
troll! Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his Axes in
2 Goblin helmets. Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of
Goblins with their swords. Legolas fires deadly arrows into
Goblin throats, desperately trying to Shield the Hobbits!
Gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle! The
cave troll is sweeping his club at Aragorn...who stumbles
backwards...the huge club descends for the killing
blow...suddenly, in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword
slices into the Scaly arm of the troll; it rears back,
spewing green blood! Sam is backing up against a wall...a
sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. In desperation
he swings wildly at a Goblin with a saucepan! It keels
over...Sam looks surprised. He wallops another Goblin and it
too, drops.

                    SAM
          I think I'm getting the hang of this.

The Cave Troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest
with his spear.

                     FRODO
          Aragorn!   Aragorn!

Sam screams as Frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip
and slammed against the wall.

                    ARAGORN
              (shocked yell)
          Frodo!!

The hobbits go crazy. Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee,
bringing him down...Merry and Pippin jump on him...Legolas
fires an arrow...and the cave troll topples, dead. Aragorn
rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor...Frodo
appears to be dead. Close on: Gandalf, Aragorn, Hobbits
looking horrified... Suddenly Frodo coughs...takes a huge
breath.

                    SAM
          He's alive!

                    FRODO
          I'm alright. I'm not hurt.

                    ARAGORN
          You should be dead. That spear would've
          skewered a wild boar!

                    GANDALF
          I think there's more to this hobbit than
          meets the eye.

Frodo open his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest.   The Troll
Spear did not pierce the mithril."

                    GIMLI
          Mithril! You are full of surprises,
          Master Baggins.

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM     the sound of the drums rings out again!
Gandalf turns to the others.

They hurry towards a distant door...as Goblins start
scuttling down the Pillars behind them, like cockroaches!
Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army
that's rushing toward them! SUDDENLY! A deafening roar fills
the air! A fiery light dances down the hallway... the
pillars casting eerie shadows. The Goblins freeze. They back
Fearfully away from the approaching beast...melting into the
darkness.

                    BOROMIR
          What is this new devilry?

A HUGE SHADOW, surrounded by flame, falls across the
hall..the ground shakes...an unearthly sound rumbles...

                    GANDALF
              (quietly)
          A Balrog..a demon of the ancient world!
          This foe is beyond any of you!

          Run! Quickly!

INT. STAIRWAY OF KHASAD-DUM, MORIA -- DAY

The BALROG, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great
40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames! In one hand is a
blade...like a stabbing tongue of fire; in the other, a WHIP
of many thongs. Aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a
dizzying stairway...Gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his
staff. Close on: Aragorn looks at Gandalf, concerned.

                    GANDALF
          Lead them on, Aragorn.   The bridge is
          near.

Aragorn hesitates...Gandalf looks at him.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Do as I say; swords are no more use here.

THE FELLOWSHIP race down the stairway, Aragorn picks up
Frodo..leaping across a gaping chasm. A NARROW BRIDGE,
spanning a bottomless pit...Gandalf yells to the others:
Aragorn makes to throw Gimli across the Chasm.

                    GIMLI
          Nobody tosses a dwarf! The BALROG smashes
          through the wall and spreads its vast
          wings.

              (yelling)
          Over the bridge! Fly!

They race towards the slender bridge of stone...without kerb
or rail...at the far end of the hall. The Fellowship
recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge..but Gandalf... the
last..pauses in the middle of the span...he faces the
Balrog...staff in one hand...Sword in the other! Frodo looks
back in horror:

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          You cannot pass!

          I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
          wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark
          fire will not avail you, flame of Udun.

Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and
draws up to Full Height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall.
Gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow
bridge.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Go back to the shadow! The BALROG slashes
          at Gandalf with its Sword of

flame...Gandalf blocks with his sword...a ringing clash and
the Balrog's sword shatters into molten fragments!

GANDALF CRIES ALOUD as he summons up his LAST RESERVES OF

He thumps the bridge with his staff...a blinding sheet of
white flame springs up... the staff shatters...the bridge
breaks... right at Balrog's feet. The stone bridge drops away
into the gulf...from under the Balrog. For a moment, the
great Beast remains poised in the air...then it plunges down:
in slow motion Relief floods Frodo's face..Gandalf remains
trembling on the lip of the broken bridge. Slow motion: As
the Balrog falls, he lashes out with his whip of fire... Slow
motion: The thongs of the whip lash and curl around Gandalf's
knees, dragging him over the brink! Gandalf just manages to
hand on by his fingertips

wonderment at the vista spread before them.

Several miles towards the South, a Large Hill rises out of
the woods. Upon the hill rise many mighty Mallorn Trees,
taller than any others...Nestled high in the crown of the
mallorns is a Beautiful City. It Gleams in the low rays of
the late afternoon sun..green, gold, and silver. To the east
of Caras Galadhon, the Woods of Lorien run down the pale
gleam of Anduin, the great river. Beyond the River, the land
appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away,
it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. The Sun that lies
on Lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie
beyond.

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP

step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light. The walls
are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the
trunk of the might Mallorn tree, now tapering toward its
crown. Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. His hair
is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no
sign of age upon it. Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady
of the Elves. She has hair of deep gold and timeless,
unsurpassed beauty. Celeborn looks hard at Aragorn...

                    CELEBORN
          Eight there are, yet nine there were set
          out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is

          fail, to the ruin of all...Yet hope
          remains while the company is true.

Galadriel's eyes settle on Sam.

Moonlight catches the trace of tears on Boromir's face.
Aragorn kneels down beside him.

          failing and our..our people lose faith.
          He looks to me to make things right...and
          I would do it, I would see the glory of
          Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it,
          Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion,
          glimmering like a spike of pearl and
          silver, its banners caught high in the
          morning breeze...have you ever been
          called home by the clear ringing of
          silver trumpets?

                    ARAGORN
          I have seen the white city..long ago.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

Boromir feels Aragorn's love for Minas Tirith and takes
heart,

                      BOROMIR
            One day our paths will lead us there, and
            the tower guards shall take up the call
             "the Lords of Gondor have returned."

Aragorn returns Boromir's smile...betraying his disquiet
sadness only when Boromir looks away.

                                                          CUT TO:

LATER....

The Fellowship are asleep on their beds. Gimli is snoring
loudly. CLOSE ON: BARE FEET tread soundlessly across the
lawn. CLOSE ON: Frodo's eyes flicker open...as if by
instinct. GALADRIEL, her White dress glowing in the
moonlight, glances at him. Frodo follows her...as if drawn by
an invisible force.

                                                          CUT TO:

EXT. GALADRIELS GLADE, LORTHLORIEN -- NIGHT

Upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits
a shallow Silver Basin. Galadriel leads Frodo into the small
Glade.

                      GALADRIEL
            Will you look into the mirror? Frodo
            looks with apprehension at the silver
            basin.

                      FRODO
                (warily)
            What will I see?

Galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug...a
glow rises from the water.

                      GALADRIEL
            Even the wisest cannot tell for the
            mirror shows many things...things that
            were ..things that are...and some things
            that have not yet come to pass.

Frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal...he peers     into the
glossy surface. The night sky is reflected into     the water...
suddenly a figure takes form...the bowed figure     of an old
man, clad in white robes. He walks down a long      road. Frodo
leans closer to the mirror's surface...

                                                          103.



CLOSE ON: GANDALF LIFTS HIS HEAD AND LOOKS DIRECTLY AT FRODO!

FRODO gasps, his face lighting up with hope.

                    FRODO
              (joyous)
          Gandalf!

Gandalf looks at Frodo with a fierce intensity. Frodo
reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror.
Suddenly the image flares, burning out to white. The vision
shifts...Frodo gasps in horror! The Shire is in ruins! The
image suddenly widens to fill the screen...buildings
burning...bodies strewn about...Dark Shapes of ORCS looting
and destroying...Bag End, billowing in flames! The Party
tree is hacked down. Frodo reels back as the mirror seems to
grow...the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing
him entirely.

IMAGE: Hobbiton...now an Industrial wasteland! The fields
and trees destroyed...replaced with Brick factories belching
smoke! IMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled Hobbits into the
Factories! We see Sam...Merry... and Rosie Cotton. Soot-
stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell-
hole! Suddenly, the mirror goes dark...and out of the black
abyss a single eye grows. CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN. Unable
to move or cry out. The ring dangles from his neck, inches
above the water...not shimmering with curls of steam. Fire
erupts around the eye... With a Yell, Frodo pushes himself
away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. Light
instantly fades from the mirror. Frodo comes to his
senses...he is shocked. Galadriel stands still as a statue,
unmoved, untouched by the horror.

                    GALADRIEL
          I know what it is you saw...for it is
          also in my mind. It is the future,
          Frodo. It is what will come to pass if
          you should fail.

Galadriel looks at Frodo intensely...Frodo looks down...in
his hand he is clutching the ring. Frodo looks up at
Galadriel.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          The fellowship is breaking. It has
          already begun. He will try to take the
          ring. You know of whom I speak. One by
          one, it will destroy them all.

                    FRODO (V.O.)
          If you ask it of me, I will give you the
          One Ring.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                         104.
CONTINUED:


                    GALADRIEL
          You offer it to me freely...I do not deny
          that my heart has greatly desired this.

Galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before Frodo's
eyes. Frodo is suddenly afraid of her.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          In place of the Dark Lord, you would have
          a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and
          terrible as the Dawn. Treacherous as the
          Sea! Stronger than the foundations of
          the earth...all shall love me and
          despair! Frodo takes a step away from
          Galadriel...

Galadriel suddenly laughs...a slender Elf-woman once more,
clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
              (gently)
          I pass the test.
              (laughs)
          I will diminish and go into the west and
          remain Galadriel. Frodo's confidence
          drains away.

                    FRODO
          I cannot do this alone...

                    GALADRIEL
          You are the ring-bearer, Frodo...to bear
          a ring of power is to be alone. This task
          was appointed to you, and if you do not
          find a way, no one will.

Frodo realizes what her message is.

                    FRODO
          Then I know what I must do. It's
          just...I'm afraid to do it. Galadriel
          kneels down to Frodo's height, staring at
          him intently.

                    GALADRIEL
          Even the smallest person can change the
          course of the future.

The Ring lies in the palm of Frodo's hand...his fingers close
over it.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. ORTHANC CHAMBER -- DAY

Naked, Lurtz's eyes follow Saruman, alight with a mean
intelligence.

                    SARUMAN (V.O.)
              (smiles)
          They were Elves once. Taken by the Dark
          Powers ... tortured and mutilated...a
          ruined and terrible form of life. And
          now...perfected. My fighting Uruk-Hai.
          Whom do you serve?

                    LURTZ
              (gutteral rasp)
          Saruman.

INT. CAVERNS BELOW ISENGARD -- DAY

QUICK CUTS: LURTZ is quickly armored...Breastplate...Leg
guards, Helmet...a sword is thrust in Lurtz's hand. The URUK-
HAI are smearing themselves in white paint...a creepy
ritualistic ceremony...the white hand of Isengard is smeared
on bodies, faces, and armor. SARUMAN address a crowd of 200
fully armed URUK-HAI.

                    SARUMAN
          Hunt them down. Do not stop until they
          are found. You do not know pain. You do
          not know fear. You will taste man-flesh.
          Saruman turns to Lurtz.

                    SARUMAN (CONT'D)
              (coldly)
          One of the Halflings carries something of
          great value...bring him to me...alive and
          unspoiled...kill the others.

EXT. ISENGARD -- DAY

Lurtz is leading 200 URUK-HAI out of Isengard..they run fast,
their powerful legs carrying them at speed.

EXT. SILVERLODE RIVER BANK--DAWN

The Fellowship are in small elven boats. They row away from
the Lothlorien Shore into the Silverlode river. Elves
quietly watch them depart. Galadriel gives Frodo a small
Crystal Phial.

                    GALADRIEL
          Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the
          light of Earendil, our most beloved star.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            106.
CONTINUED:


As the Fellowship's boats drift past, Galadriel stands alone,
watching from the banks of the river. In his head, Frodo
still hears her voice...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          May it be a light for you in dark places,
          when all other lights go out.

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY

The boats pass into the great river Anduin. The Three Elven
boats carry the Fellowship steadily southward. Green trees
slowly give way to a brown and withered land.

EXT. FOREST -- DAY

The Uruk forces are running through the trees with deadly
purpose.

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY

A flock of birds circle high above, Black against the pale
sky. Aragorn watches them with concern.

EXT. PILLARS OF THE KINGS, RIVER ANDUIN--DAWN

The Three Elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky
gorge in the Pre-dawn light. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN, slowly
paddling in the stern.

                    ARAGORN
              (quietly)
          Frodo.

Frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. Wide
on: Two enormous rock statues, towering like 300 foot
pinnacles on either side of the river...carved images of
Gondorian kings of old. They loom over the boats with power
and majesty.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
          The Argonath...

Close on: Aragorn...strangely moved by the beauty of the
silent sentinels. He speaks, almost as if to himself.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (deeply moved)
          Long have I desired to look upon the
          kings of old...my kin.

The fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes
them through the narrow gap between the Statues' feet.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


Wide on: Craning up past the statues vast crumbling heads, to
reveal a large lake only a mile down river...

EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP

As they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded
shore.

                    ARAGORN
          We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the
          boats and continue on foot..we approach
          Mordor from the North.

                    GIMLI
              (gloomy)
          Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding
          our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable
          labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. And
          after that gets even better...a
          festering, stinking marshland, far as the
          eye can see.

                    ARAGORN
          That is our Road...I suggest you take
          some rest and recover your strength,
          Master Dwarf.

                    GIMLI
              (indignant)
          Recover my...

Legolas turns to Aragorn with urgency.

                    LEGOLAS
          We should leave now.

                    ARAGORN
          No. Orcs patrol the Eastern shore. We
          must wait for cover of darkness.

                    LEGOLAS
          It is not the Eastern shore that worries
          me.

Legolas casts a glance around into the Parth Galen forest...

                    LEGOLAS (CONT'D)
          A shadow and a threat has been growing in
          my mind. Something draws near, I can
          feel it.


                                                  (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


Aragorn looks at Legolas, knowing full well what he means.
Sam has slumped asleep...Merry dumps a small pile of kindling
at Gimli's feet...

                    MERRY
          Where's Frodo?

Sam sits up with a start...Aragorn's head snaps round..his
eyes fly to Boromir's shield which lies abandoned by his camp
bed. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN.... as he realizes Boromir has gone!

EXT. SLOPES OF AMON HEN -- DAY

Frodo is walking beneath the trees...lost in thought. His
feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab...his eyes
follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the
summit of Amon Hen...the seeing seat. A CRACKLING SOUND!
Frodo freezes....

                    BOROMIR
              (quietly)
          None of us should wander alone; you least
          of all. So much depends on you...Frodo?

Frodo turns slowly...he stares at Boromir, tense, cautious.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          I know why you seek solitude. You
          suffer, I see it day by day. Are you
          sure you do not suffer needlessly?

Frodo stands silent for a moment..the murmur of the Wind in
the trees and the distant roar of the falls of Rauros can be
heard

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          Let me help you. There are other ways,
          Frodo..other paths that we might take.

                    FRODO
          I know what you would say, and it would
          seem like wisdom but for the warning of
          my heart.

                     BOROMIR
          Warning?   Against what?

Boromir has started forward towards Frodo, he pulls himself
up.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          We are all afraid, Frodo. But to let that
          fear drive us to destroy what hope we
          have...don't you see that is madness?

                    FRODO
          There is no other way.

                    BOROMIR
          I ask only for the strength to defend my
          people.
              (angrily drops the wood he has
               collected)
          If you would but lend me the ring...

                    FRODO
          No. . .

Frodo steps hurriedly away from Boromir.

                    BOROMIR
          Why do you recoil?   I am no thief.

                     FRODO
              (wary)
          You are not yourself.

                    BOROMIR
          What chance do you think you have? They
          will find you, they will take the ring
          and you will beg for death before the
          end.

Frodo turns to leave.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          You fool! It is not yours save by
          unhappy chance...it might have been mine.
          It should be mine. Give it to me! Give
          me the ring.

Boromir leaps on top of Frodo, grasping for the ring! Frodo
has only moments to act. Frodo rips the ring from around his
neck..and rams it on his finger.

                    FRODO DISAPPEARS
          Boromir spins wildly around, yelling into
          thin air!

                    BOROMIR
          I see your mind...you will take the ring
          to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to
          your death and the death of us all.

            shakes as if in the Throes of a
            fit...slowly he comes to.

EXT. SEEING SEAT -- DAY

                                          IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:

FRODO races through the misty twilight world, past the foggy
shapes of twisted trees. Somewhere behind him, Boromir's
distraught voice carries from another dimension:

                      BOROMIR (O.S.)
            I'm sorry, Frodo...Frodo...

Frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps...he clambers
up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone
pillars. Frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the
throne of mountain kings. The world of mist swirls around
him. Frodo peers out from the seat...the world seems to
shrink. In all directions, Views of far off lands telescope
towards him through the mist. IMAGES: ORCS spilling out of
holes in the misty mountains... flames rising from
Mirkwood...grim faced easterlings march to war...black ships
sailing into the south. All the power of the Dark Lord is in
motion. Frodo moves his gaze towards the east...fire explodes
against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills
Frodo's vision. A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong,
tower of adamant: Barad-dur, FORTRESS OF SAURON!

SUDDENLY!   SAURON'S EYE LEAPS TOWARD FRODO LIKE A FINGER OF

LIGHT.

SAURON (V.O.)

(IN BLACK SPEECH)

They will fall! Frodo leaps off the seat, and tumbles down
the stairs! The eye sweeps Amon Hen like a searchlight,
seeking its ring! With a huge effort, Frodo wrenches the ring
off his finger...

EXT. SUMMIT OF AMON HEN -- DAY

Frodo lies gasping on the summit of Amon Hen...below the
ancient ruins of the seeing seat.

                                                            111.



AT THAT MOMENT: A BLACK BOOT STEPS INTO SHOT!

Frodo looks up as Aragorn towers over him.

                       ARAGORN
          Frodo?

                     FRODO
              (numb)
          It has taken Boromir. ARAGORN moves
          towards Frodo...

                    ARAGORN
              (urgent)
          Where is the ring?

Frodo backs away from Aragorn...Aragorn is shocked by the
movement.

                       FRODO
          Stay away!

                    ARAGORN
          Frodo...I swore to protect you.

                    FRODO
          Can you protect me from yourself?

Frodo uncurls his fist...in is palm lies the ring! It
glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun...Aragorn's
eyes are drawn to it.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Would you destroy it?

                    ARAGORN
              (kneeling to Frodo)
          I would have gone with you to the end...
          into the very fires of Mordor.

                    FRODO
          I know...Look after the others,
          especially Sam...he will not understand.

Aragorn freezes!   He draws his sword.

                     ARAGORN
              (urgent)
          Go, Frodo!

Frodo hesitates.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (yells)
          Run! Run!!

Frodo backs away into the trees...as 200 URUK-HAI SWARM onto
Amon Hen behind Aragorn!

Aragorn attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman... he
brings two down with his sword...leaping into the ruins as
others close in on him. Frodo scrambles down the hillside,
away from the fight. Aragorn battles the URUK-HAI, amongst
the pillars and blocks of Amon Hen. Despite his bravery, he
is quickly surrounded... SUDDENLY: ELVEN ARROWS smash into
the URUK-HAI. Legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow.
Gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe.

EXT. PARTH GALEN HILLSIDE -- DAY

Frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feet
thunder down behind him.

                       SAM
          Mr. Frodo!

Sam looks around for Frodo. CLOSE ON: LURTZ ordering his
URUKS.

                     LURTZ
          Find the Halflings ... find the
          halflings!

Frodo stumbles and falls...quickly he crawls behind a
tree...above him the sound of Uruk-Hai crashing through the
forest rings out.

                    MERRY (O.S.)
              (urgent whisper)
          Frodo!

Frodo turns to see Merry and Pippin hidden in a hollow, a few
feet away.

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
          Hide here, quick!

                       PIPPIN
          Come on...

Frodo looks at his friends... slowly shakes his head, a great
sadness in his eyes...

                    PIPPIN (CONT'D)
          What's he doing?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

Merry's eyes meet Frodo's.        Understanding.

                    MERRY
              (softly)
          He's leaving.

                        PIPPIN
          No!

Pippin stands and makes a move toward Frodo...Merry grabs at
his arm.

                        MERRY
          Pippin!

THE ECHO OF BOROMIR'S HORN reaches Aragorn, Legolas, and
Gimli...they are battling their way down the Slopes towards
the lake.

                    LEGOLAS
          The horn of Gondor!

                        ARAGORN
          Boromir!

Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, felling
URUK-HAI in his path...while Legolas and Gimli fight a rear
guard action. MANY URUK-HAI fall to Boromir's sword as he
tries to protect Merry and Pippin...

                        BOROMIR
          Run!   Run!

Lurtz takes aim. A black arrow suddenly thuds into Boromir's
chest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another
arrow...and another, brings him to his knees. Merry and
Pippin are scooped off their feet by URUK-HAI.

                        MERRY & PIPPIN
          Aaaaagh!      Boromir! Boromir!

Lurtz aims his bow at Boromir's heart... suddenly Aragorn
charges at him, smashing the Bow with his sword. They lock
into a deadly battle. Aragorn cuts Lurtz down and races
towards Boromir, who lies slumped against a tree...URUK-HAI
arrows sticking out of his chest. At least 20 dead URUK-HAI
lie heaped around Boromir. His horn lies at his feet...Cloven
in two.

                    BOROMIR
              (painful gasp)
          They took the little ones...

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          Aragorn quickly tries to staunch the flow
          of Blood from Boromir's shoulder.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
              (panicked)
          Frodo...where is Frodo?

                    ARAGORN
          I let Frodo go.

Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze.

                    BOROMIR
          Then you did what I could not.   I tried
          to take the ring from him.

                    ARAGORN
          The ring is beyond our reach now.

                    BOROMIR
          Forgive me, I did not see..I have failed
          you all.

                    ARAGORN
          No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You
          have kept your honor. Aragorn tries to
          bind Boromir's wound.

                    BOROMIR
          Leave it! It is over...the world of Men
          will fall and all will come to darkness
          and my city to ruin..Aragorn..

                    ARAGORN
          I do not know what strength is in my
          blood, but I swear to you... I will not
          let the White City fall, nor your people
          fail...

                    BOROMIR
          Our people...our people...

Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand.   Boromir's
fingers tighten around the hilt.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          I would have followed you, my
          brother...my captain, my King. Aragorn
          lays Boromir down. He is dead.

                    ARAGORN
          Be at peace, son of Gondor. Aragorn bends
          and Kisses Boromir's forehead.

                     ARAGORN (CONT'D)
           They will look for his coming from the
           white tower...but he will not return.

EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY

On the lakeshore Frodo stands in front of one of the Elvish
Boats, the ring in his palm. A distraught Sam...running as
hard as he can through the forest...

                        SAM
           Mr. Frodo!

Close on: Frodo looks to the far side of the river...the
camera moves in on the ring.

                     FRODO (V.O.)
           I wish the ring had never come to me..I
           wish none of this had happened...

Tears fall down Frodo's face...

                     GANDALF (V.O.)
           So do all who lie to see such times...but
           that is not for them to decide. All we
           have to decide is what to do with the
           time that is given us.

With renewed determination, Frodo tucks the ring inside his
vest pocket. The small figure of Frodo pushing the Elvish
boat into the water... Sam bursts through the trees and runs
toward the lake...Frodo is already paddling away.

                     SAM
               (anguished)
           Not alone, Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo, in
           the boat, paddling steadfastly away from
           the

shore..tears in his eyes..the voice of Sam carried on the
wind. Frodo whispers to himself

                        FRODO
           No, Sam.

Sam looks at the water...then at the boat.

SPLASH!   FRODO turns to see Sam launching himself into the
water.

CONTINUED:


                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Go back,Sam. I'm going to Mordor alone.

Sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat.

                    SAM
          Of course you are...and I'm coming with
          you!

                    FRODO
          You can't swim.

Sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing...Frodo
drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat...

                       FRODO (CONT'D)
                 (frightened)
          Sam!

Sam is underwater...hands flailing helplessly as he sinks.
Close on: Frodo's hand grasping Sam's... Frodo pulls a
bedraggled and half drowned Sam into the boat. Frodo and Sam
look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming
down both their faces.

                     SAM
          I made a promise, Mr. Frodo...a promise.
              (fierce passion)
          "Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."
              (sobs)
          And I don't mean to...I don't mean to.

                    FRODO
              (crying)
          Oh, Sam!

Frodo starts to laugh through his tears...the two friends
hug.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Come on then..

The two Hobbits row through the water...

EXT. FALLS OF RAUROS AERIAL -- DAY

Slow motion: Looking down on swiftly flowing
water...Boromir's body slides under camera.

He is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his
chest..his broken horn at his side. Suddenly... the boat
drops away from camera...as it plunges over the massive falls
of Rauros, disappearing into the vapor below.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    LEGOLAS
          If we are quick, we will catch Frodo and
          Sam before nightfall.

Aragorn looks towards the far shore; Frodo and Sam's small
Boat can be seen lying on the distant Riverbank as Frodo and
Sam make off into the forest beyond. He doesn't react.
Legolas turns and looks at Aragorn.

                    LEGOLAS (CONT'D)
          You mean not to follow them...

                    ARAGORN
          Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

                    GIMLI
          Then it has all been in vain...the
          fellowship has failed.

                    ARAGORN
          Not if we hold true to each other. We
          will not abandon Merry and Pippin to
          torment and death, not while we have
          strength left.

Aragorn pulls a HUNTING KNIFE out of his pack and straps it
on.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
          Leave all that can be spared behind...
          CLOSE ON: ARAGORN..a steely light in his
          eye.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (grimly)
          We travel light. Let's hunt some Orc.

                       GIMLI
          Yes!   Ha!

Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli disappear into the Woods,
following the URUK-HAI trail.

EXT. EMYN MUIL HILLTOP -- DAY

Frodo and Sam scramble onto a high ridge.

A distant line of Saw toothed mountains below a dark,
oppressive sky. Black volcanic smoke rises behind the
mountains....MORDOR!

          road.

                    SAM
              (simply)
          Strider'll look after them.

                    FRODO
          I don't suppose we'll ever see them
          again.

                    SAM
          We may yet, Mr. Frodo.   We may.

                     FRODO
          Sam?

Frodo looks at Sam with great affection..despite the grim
outlook, Sam is undeterred...

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          I'm glad you're with me.

SAM twitches in a RESTLESS SLEEP. But FRODO is awake . . . His

                        FRODO
             No . . . no it isn't. It isn't midday yet.
             The days are growing darker.

The GROUND suddenly QUIVERS, as a ROLLING, RUMBLING NOISE
ECHOES down the VALLEY.

                        GOLLUM
             Come on, must go, no time ...

                        SAM
             Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat.

                        GOLLUM
             . . . no time to lose, silly.

SAM shoots GOLLUM a HOSTILE LOOK and turns back to rummage in
his KNAPSACK. He holds up a piece of dried LEMBAS BREAD to
FRODO.

                        SAM
             Here.

                        FRODO
             What about you?

                        SAM
                  (lying badly)
             I'm not hungry - leastways, not for lembas
             bread.

                        FRODO
             Sam.

                        SAM
                  (confessing)
             Alright. We don't have that much left.

            We have to be careful or we're going to run
            out. You go ahead and eat that, Mr Frodo.
            I've rationed it. There should be enough.

FRODO looksa t SAM questioningly.

                        FRODO
            For what?

                       SAM
            The journey home.

FRODO says nothing.                                            .

EXT. CULVERT, VALE OF MORGUL - DAY

WIDE: FRODO and SAM follow GOLLUM as he leads them on the
wining, torturous path ... clambering through BRACKEN and
over JAGGED ROCKS.

                       GOLLUM
            Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close
            to Mordor! No safe places here. Hurry!
            Shhh.

EXT. THE FOREST OF ISENGARD. DAY

GANDALF leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, THEODEN and GIMLI through
dark woodland . . .

The MOVING FOREST of FANGORN ...opens before them . . .

Far off, half veiled int he swirling STEAM, the TOWER of
ORTHANC stands ... Unbroken by the storm. Pale waters lap
about its feet.

ANGLE ON: TWO SMALL HOBBITS are sitting on the SMASHED WALL
. . . MERRY and PIPPIN! SPREAD before them is a feast of
BREADS, MEATS and WINE. They PUFF on long pipes as they lie
back in the SUN.

                       PIPPIN
             I feel like I ' m back at the Green Dragon,
             after a hard days work.

                       MERRY
             Only, you've never done a hard days work.

MERRY cuts PIPPIN off before he can respond in kind.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Welcome, my Lords, to Isengard.

                        GANDALF

ANGLE ON: GANDALF, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI stare at the
SIGHT before them . . .

                       GIMLI
             You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led
             us on, and now we find you feasting and
             smoking.

                        PIPPIN
                  (mouth full)
             We are sitting on a field of victory,
             enjoying a few well-earned comforts.
             The salted pork is particularly good.

             Salted pork?

                     MERRY
           We're under orders from Treebeard, who's
           taken over management of Isengard.

WIDE: GANDALF leads the company through the flotsam and
jetsam which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the
TOWER ... TREEBEARD, the GIANT ENT, strides towards them,
ALARMING all but GANDALF.



                     TREEBEARD
           Huraroom ... Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad
           you've come. Wood and water, stock and ,
           stone I can master, but there's a wizard to
           be managed here ... Locked in his tower.

                      GANDALF
           And there Saruman must remain, under your
           guard, Treebeard.

                     GIMLI
           Let's just have his head and be done with
           it.                            .

GANDALF stares up the long length of the DARK TOWER . . .

                      GANDALF
                (quietly)
           No. He has no power any more.

THE OLD ENT nods his head wisely . . .

                       TREEBEARD
           The filth of Saruman is washing away ...
           Trees will come back to live here, young
           trees . . . wild trees.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, his eye caught by something lying in the WATER

ANGLE ON: The MUDDY waters GLOWING wit a golden light . . .

ARAGORN turns as, quick as a FLASH, PIPPIN has jumped off his
ho rse an d pi cke d u p -- th e PA LAN TIR !

PIPPIN doesn't move, his eyes staring in wonder at the smooth
black stone ...

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
            Quickly, now!

RELUCTANTLY, PIPPIN hands the PALANTIR to GANDALF ... who
immediately smothers it in his cloak.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks back at PIPPIN . . . troubled.

EXT. EDORAS - DAY

CITY of EDORAS . . .

INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - EVENING

WIDE: A ROARING FIRE; a LAMB ROASTING on SPI; LONG TABLES
laden with FOOD; BARRELS of WINE; a banquet is-laid ready for

                       THEODEN
            Tonight we remember those who gave their
            blood to defend this country. Hail the
            victorious dead!

ANGLE ON: Amidst the cheering crowd, EOWYN moves towards
ARAGORN . . . As she proffers the CHALICE their eyes meet.

                       EOWYN
            Westu Aragorn hal.

EOWYN watches as ARAGORN moves away . . . a voice speaks in her
ear.

                        THEODEN
             I am happy for you.

EOWYN looks at her UNCLE, as THEODEN follows her gaze.

                       THEODEN (cont'd)
             He is an honourable man.

             You are both honourable men.

                        THEODEN
             It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our
             people to victory.

EOWYN looks at him questioningly, disturbed'by his tone.

                       T HE ODE N ( co nt' d)
             Don't listen to me - you are young, and
             tonight is for you.

ANGLE ON: EOWYN watches concerned as her UNCLE moves away.

ANGLE ON: MERRY & PIPPIN are in full voice, on top of one of the
TABLES . . . both hold very large mugs of ALE in their hands.

             Oh, you can search - up and down
             As many lands as can be found
             But you'll never find a beer so brown
             As the one we drink in our home town
             You can keep your fancy ales
             You can drink them by the flagon
             But the only brew, for the brave and true,
             Comes from the Green Dragon!

ANGLE ON: GANDALF laughing and clapping the HOBBITS. ARAGORN
steps up beside him, SMILING at the floorshow.

          No news of Frodo?

          No word ... nothing.

                     ARAGORN
          We till have time.

GANDALF turns quickly to ARAGORN.

                    ARAGORN (cont'd)
          Every day Frpdo moves closer to Mordor.

GANDALF watches his friend's face . . . seeking reassurance.

                    GANDALF
          Do we know that?

                     ARAGORN

          What does your heart tell you?

          That Frodo is alive.
               (to himself)
          Yes - yes, he is alive.

EXT. MORGUL VALLEY - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes near a
stagnant pool. SMEAGOL lies nearby, muttering in his sleep.

                     SMEAGOL
          Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They
          stole it from us. Kill them . . . kill them
          ... kill them both!

SMEAGOL wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in SWEAT,
eyes wide in horror.

                     SME AGO L (c ont' d)
          No!

             Shhh! Quiet!

SMEAGOL'S features suddenly transform into the MALEVOLENT
face of GOLLUM!

                        GOLLUM (cont'd)
             Mustn't wake them, mustn't ruin it now!

SMEAGOL casts a quick glance over his SHOULDER to the
SLEEPING figures of FRODO and SAM as he clambers off his ROCK
. . . silently sidling towards the EDGE of a STAGNANT POOL.

                        SMEAGOL
             They knows, they knows, they suspects us.



SMEAGOL stares into the MURKY depths of the WATER.

The SURFACE RIPPLES as the face of GOLLUM appears as SMEAGOL'S
REFLECTION.

             Hobbitses! Smeagol wants to see: them -

           We must get the Precious. We must get it
           back.

                      GOLLUM
           Patience, patience, my love. First we must
           lead them to her.

                      SMEAGOL

           Orcses.

                       SAM
            I don't care! I can't do it, Mr Frodo. I
            won' t wait around for him to kill us !

                       FRODO
                 (fierce whisper)
            I'm not sending him away.

SAM stares at FRODO . . . at a loss.

                       SAM
            You don't see it, do you? He's a villain!

                       FRODO
                 (lowers voice)
            We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not
            without a guide. I need you on my side.

ANGLE ON: SAM, his face softening.

           I know, Sam, I know.
                (whisper)
           You must trust me.

FRODO beckons to GOLLUM.

                      FRODO (cont'd)
           Come, Smeagol.

GOLLUM turns slowly, staring at SAM through hooded, HATE-FILLED
EYES ... and SMILES.

EXT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - EARLY DAWN

ARAGORN joins LEGOLAS on the STEPS to the GOLDEN HALL, oblivious
to the CHILL WIND . . . they look out across the SLEEPING CITY to
the LOOMING MOUNTAIN RANGE BEYOND . .-. DARK CLOUDS mark the sky.

                      LEGOLAS
           The stars are veiled, something stirs in
           the east . . . A sleepless malice.

LEGOLAS looks at ARAGORN . . . realisation in his face.

                      LEGOLAS (cont'd)
           The eye of the enemy is moving.

INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - EARLY DAWN,

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN . . . he is AWAKE! He sits up . . . ANXIOUS,
FIDGETY . . .

Suddenly he hops out of bed and creeps towards the SLEEPING FORM
of GANDALF.

                      MERRY
           (whispers)
           What you doing?

PIPPIN gasps with FRIGHT! MERRY is sitting up, wiping sleep
from his eyes. He moves on . . .

ANGLE ON: A sleeping GANDALF lies with eyes wide open! But
PIPPIN is undeterred . . .

MERRY sits up, a worried look on his face.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin? Pippin? Pippin! What are you doing?

With quick stealth, PIPPIN lifts the WRAPPED PALANTIR from
GANDALF'S grasp ...

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin, are you mad?

                        PIPPIN
             I just want to look at it. Just one more
             time.

                       MERRY
             Put it back! Put - it - back!

PIPPIN unwraps the PALANTIR and as MERRY looks on HORRIFIED,
he gazes INTENTLY into it.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin!

As PIPPIN lays his hands on the CRYSTAL, a SICKLY PALE light
slowly spreads from the GLASS BALL onto PIPPIN'S FACE ... his
EYES WIDEN.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin!

             He is here.

INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

PIPPIN suddenly starts to HYPERVENTILATE . . . He STAGGERS
BACKWARDS, PALANTIR held rigidly before him . . .

THE GREAT EYE OF SAURON seems to LEAP from the FIRE . . . PIPPIN
is bathed in the FIERY RED LIGHT.

PIPPIN sinks to his KNEES, his mouth open in a soundless SCREAM
. . . He FALLS BACKWARDS, powerless to release the FIERY GLOBE.

                        MERRY
             Help! Someone help him!

GANDALF wakes with a start! Just as ARAGORN enters, and
wrenches the PALANTIR from PIPPIN'S HANDS . . . PIPPIN FALLS to
the FLOOR! . . . ARAGORN spins away, reeling backwards, the
PALANTIR falling from his HANDS . . .

The PALANTIR rolls across the FLOOR, causing EVERYONE in the
room to COWER BACK.                                    ;


ANGLE ON: GANDALF throws a BLANKET over it, ANGRY DISBELIEF
on his face! He rounds on PIPPIN.                    ,

                        GANDALF
             Fool of a Took!

GANDALF lifts the HOBBIT'S SLUMPED HEAD.

                        MERRY
             Pippin!

PIPPIN is trembling ... GANDALF calms him . . .

FLASH INSERT: A lone white tree silhouetted by flames.

          Ring?

INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - DAY

THEODEN stands in the GOLDEN HALL, gravely listening to
GANDALF ... ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI look on . . .

                     GANDALF
          There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool,
          but an honest fool he remains. He told
          Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

ANGLE ON: GIMLI lets out a sigh of relief.

GANDALF turns to look at THEODEN.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             We've been strangely fortunate. What Pippin
             saw in the Palantir was a glimpse of our
             enemy's plan.

GANDALF looks from on to the other of the, gathered company.

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas
             Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed
             our enemy one thing.

The WIZARD turns towards ARAGORN . . .

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             The heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are
             not as weak as he supposed. There is
             courage still - strength enough left to
             challenge him.

THEODEN listens intently, saying nothing.

                                    GANDALF (cont'd)

ANGLE ON: GANDALF rounds on THEODEN . . .

             If the beacons of Condor are lit, Rohan
             must be ready for war!

THEODEN holds GANDALF'S gaze.

           those who did not come to ours?

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to look at THEODEN.

                      THEODEN (cont'd)
           What do we owe Gondor?

                      ARAGORN

           Understand this . . . things are now in
           motion that cannot be undone.

GANDALF turns on his heel . . . and stares at a surpirsed
PIPPIN.

                      GANDALF (cont'd)
           I ride for Minas Tirith! And I won't be

SLOW MOTION: As ARWEN rides through the FOREST the FIGURE of
a SMALL BOY of about 5 SUDDENLY runs across the path in front

As ARWEN watches the BOY moves away, the TREES begin to thin
. . . the BOY continues running. One by one the TREES TRANSFORM
into TALL WHITE PILLARS ...

ARWEN'S POV: The BOY now stands within a VISION of the
majestic architecture of the great Gondorian city of MINAS
TIRITH.

A SILHOUETTED FIGURE appears in the distance and moves
towards the CHILD . . . the BOY runs to the FIGURE.

ARWEN watches as the FIGURE holds out its arms - swinging the
LAUGHING CHILD into the AIR . . .

The figure turns to reveal ... ARAGORN, a little older,
dressed in the casual finery of a GONDORIAN NOBLE.

CLOSE ON: The'CHILD, now in ARAGORN'S ARMS looks directly at
ARWEN . . . it is a QUIET LOOK filled with INFINITE SADNESS.

is gone . . . she is staring at DARK TREES once more.

fierce light in her eyes . . .

                    ARWEN
          You have the gift of foresight - tell me
          what you have seen.

                    ELROND
          I looked into your future and I saw death.

                    ARWEN
          There is also life.                           ,

Her father turns away ...

                     ARWEN (cont'd)
          You saw there was a child . . .
          you saw my son.

ELROND stares into space, the fight seems to go out of him.
He won't look at her . . .

                        ARWEN
             But it is not lost ...

                        ELROND
             Nothing is certain.

ANGLE ON: ARWEN gently takes her FATHER'S face in her hands
and turns him toward her . . .

                      ARWEN
           Some things are certain. If I leave him now
           I will regret It forever.

EXT. FOOTHILLS OF WHITE MOUNTAINS - DAY

ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX powers along the COUNTRYSIDE.

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN, huddled in front of GANDALF, the WIND
sailing through his hair.

                      GANDALF
           We have just passed into the realm of
           Condor!

EXT. MINAS TIRITH - DAWN

ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX gallops up onto a LOW RIDGE . . .

ANGLE ON: Before them is the DARK MASS of Mount Mindolluin,
its tall WHITE FACE whitening in the RISING SUN. Upon its out-
thrust knee is the Guarded City: MINAS TIRITH.

With SEVEN WALLS OF WHITE STONE, so strong and old that it
seems to have been not built, MINAS TIRITH looks carven by
giants out of the bones of the earth.

                     GANDALF
          Minas Tirith . . . City of the Kings.

Suddenly the SUN climbs over the eastern hills,     and sends
forth a SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT that GLEAMS against th    e face of the
CITY. The TOWER OF ECTHELION stands high within     the topmost
walls. WHITE BANNERS break and FLUTTER from the     BATTLEMENTS
in the morning breeze.

ANGLE ON: The stares of frightened GONDORIANS as GANDALF and
PIPPIN gallop through the WINDING STREETS . . .

AERIAL SHOT: SHADOWFAX, carrying GANDALF and PIPPIN up
towards the 7th LEVEL.

MINAS TIRITH is built in 7 LEVELS - each behind a CIRCULAR
DEFENSIVE WALL. Each level rises - the city reaches a height
of nearly 1000 FEET on its TOPMOST LEVEL.

A towering BASTION of NATURAL ROCK - shaped like a sharp
ship's prow - bisects the city from the 2nd LEVEL to the TOP.

EXT. MINAS TIRITH, COURT OF THE KINGS - DAY

SHADOWFAX arrives at a GREAT CITADEL on the SUMMIT of the
CITY - 1000 FEET above the PELENNOR FIELDS.

GANDALF and PIPPIN dismount, leaving the GUARDS of the
CITADEL to tend to SHADOWFAX. GANDALF hurries off . . .

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN as he takes in his surroundings, his eye
caught by a DEAD TREE that stands in the middle of the COURT,
FOUR SOLEMN CITADEL GUARDS standing sentry around it.

             Gandalf! Gandalf!

                       GANDALF
             Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of
             the King.

GANDALF leads PIPPIN across a FLAT COURT of WHITE STONES,
surrounded by GREEN LAWNS . . . towards a GREAT HALL benejath
the GLEAMING TOWER.                                         '

             Lord Denethor, however, is not the King. He
             is a steward only. A caretaker of the
             throne.

GANDALF lowers his voice, as they approach the TOWER HALL.

                  (quietly)
             Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is
             Boromir's father. To give him news of his
             beloved son's death would be most unwise
             ... And do not mention Frodo . . . Or the
             Ring . . . And say nothing of Aragorn either.
                  (hesitates)
             In fact, it's better if you don't speak at
             all, Pippin Took.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, suitably chastened, nods.

INT. MINAS TIRITH TOWER HALL - DAY

ANGLE ON: A LONG SOLEMN HALL ... with ROWS OF BLACK MARBLE
PILLARS. Between the pillars stand a silent company of TALL
KINGS carved in cold STONE.

GANDALF strides down the HALL, with PIPPIN following
obediently behind.

At the FAR END, upon a DAIS OF MANY STEPS, sits a LARGE,
EMPTY THRONE . . . and on the wall behind is the IMAGE of a
FLOWERING WHITE TREE set in GEMS.

At the FOOT of the DAIS, in a small STONE CHAIR, sits an OLD
MAN, gazing at his lap: DENETHOR - the Lord Steward of
CONDOR.

                        GANDALF
             Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and
             Steward of Gondor.

DENETHOR does not look up as GANDALF and PIPPIN approach.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             I come with tidings in this dark hour - and
             with counsel.

DENETHOR slowly raises COLD EYES . . .

                         DENETHOR
                  (bitter)
             Perhaps you come to explain this?

             Boromir died to save us . . . my kinsman and
             me . . . he fell, defending us from many
             foes.

CLOSE ON: DENETHOR pain flickers in his eyes.

             Pippin!

PIPPIN drops to his knee offering DENETHOR his SWORD . . .

                        PIPPIN
             I offer you my service, such as it is, in
             payment of this debt.

DENETHOR looks at PIPPIN blankly, overcome with grief.:

                         GANDALF
                  (to PIPPIN)
             Get up!

             My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for
             Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming
             ... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As
             Steward, you are charged with the defence
             of this city. Where are Condor's armies?

            Rohan. Light the beacons.

DENETHOR smiles at GANDALF, as if amused by something.

                        DENETHOR
                 (softly)
            You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for
            all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do
            you think the eyes of the White Tower are
            blind? I have seen more than you know. With
            your left hand you would use me as a shield
            against Mordor and with your right you
            would seek to supplant me.

           I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh,
           yes. Word has reached my ears of this
           Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you
           now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the
           North - last of a ragged house, long bereft
           of Lordship.

                       GANDALF

            The rule of Condor is mine, and no others!

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, horrified. GANDALF looks at Denethor
closely for a moment, then turns on his heel to leave, PIPPIN
follows.

                      GANDALF
            Come.

GANDALF and PIPPIN stride from the TOWER HALL ... DENETHOR
slumps back into his SEAT.

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN is carefully laying out a SMALL UNIFORM of
the ROYAL GUARD on a bed.

                     PIPPIN
          So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial

          It's the deep breath before the plunge.

                      PIPPIN
          I don't want to be in a battle . . . but
          waiting on the edge of one I can't escape

self-deprecating smile . . .

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Just a fool's hope.

           it.

FRODO and SAM look AGHAST at the sight of a NARROW, NEAR-
VERTICAL STAIRCASE, cut into the ROCK-FACE ... Directly in
FRONT of the MINAS MORGUL GATES.

SUDDENLY! FRODO staggers across the ROAD . . . as if some

             What's it doing?

                        SAM

                  (disorientated)
             They're calling me!

FRODO falls to the GROUND.

AT THAT MOMENT: the GROUND QUIVERS, and a great RUMBLING
NOISE rolls across the ground and ECHOES in the mountains.

The cold, dull MORGUL VALLEY is suddenly VIOLENT and FIERCE,

FRODO and SAM sink to the ground, holding their hands against
their ears, as out of the CITY comes a RENDING SCREECH . . .
SHIVERING, rising swiftly to a PIERCING PITCH beyond the

a long sickening WAIL, to SILENCE.

ANGLE ON: FRODO slowly RAISES HIS HEAD . . . across the NARROW
VALLEY, directly opposite the HOBBITS, the LORD OF THE NAZGUL
- the WITCH KING - suddenly RISES UP out of the DEAD CITY on

             This war is long planned. Sauron has hated
             the west through many ages . . . It is a
             hatred that flows from the depths of time,
             across the deeps of the Sea.

The WITCH KING SWOOPS down the VALLEY to join the HEAD of his

desperately to fend off the DEADLY ASSAULT . . .

AGAIN the FELL-BEASTS DIVE low ...

GANDALF thunders into view, raising his STAFF ...

A SHAFT OF WHITE LIGHT suddenly stabs upwards! The NAZGUL
SWERVES AWAY from the LIGHT, as it pierces the LOW CLOUD!

For a BRIEF MOMENT, SUNLIGHT streams through the hole onto
PELENNOR FIELDS . . . The NAZGUL circle away from the SUN RAYS,
swiftly spiralling higher and higher.

The NAZGUL defeated, GANDALF and the RANGERS ride towards the
safety of MINAS TIRITH.

EXT. MINAS TIRITH GATES - DAY

ANGLE ON: IORLAS runs towards the GATES, yelling . . .

The GREAT GATES OPEN, allowing GANDALF, PIPPIN, FARAMIR and
the OSGILIATH SURVIVORS to RIDE IN . . . Nearly 100 WOUNDED AND
SHOCKED MEN.

AS GANDALF pulls SHADOWFAX up . . .

                        FARAMIR
             Mithrandir!

ANGLE ON: FARAMIR STEERS HIS HORSE through the CROWD towards
GANDALF ...

                        FARAMIR   (cont'd)
             They broke through    our defences. They have
             taken the bridge a   nd the West Bank.
             Battalions of Ores    are crossing the River.

                        IORLAS
             It is as the Lord Denethor predicted - long
             has he foreseen this doom!

                        GANDALF
             Foreseen and done nothing!

FARAMIR suddenly STARES at PIPPIN. GANDALF reads the surprise
in his eyes.

                       GA ND ALF (c on t'd )
             Faramir? ... This is not the first halfling
             to have crossed your path ...

FARAMIR shakes his head.

                       FARAMIR
             No.

                        PIPPIN
                  (disbelief)
             You've seen Frodo and Sam?

FARAMIR NODS.

                       GANDALF
                 (shocked realisation)
            . . . And then the Pass of Cirith Ungol.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF, deeply troubled.

                       PIPPIN
            What does that mean? What's wrong?

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL STAIRS - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM following GOLLUM up the dizzying
STAIRWAY, carved into the SHEER CLIFF.

The STEPS are NARROW, UNEVENLY SPACED, and many are BROKEN.
They are so STEEP that FRODO and SAM climb as if on a LADDER �
their desperate FINGERS clinging to the STEPS ABOVE - trying
not to look at the LONG BLACK FALL below them.

ANGLE ON: FRODO'S foot slips and for a brief moment he is
HANGING PRECARIOUSLY from the ROCK-FACE.

                      GOLLUM
            Careful, Master - careful! Very far to
            fall. Very dangerous on the stairs.

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL LEDGE - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM peering down from ABOVE . . . he has reached a
SMALL LEDGE.

                      GOLLUM
           Come, Master.

CLOSE ON: FRODO tries to CLAMBER UP onto the LEDGE . . . as he
does, the RING slips out of his SHIRT and DANGLES in FULL

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM rears back in shock . . . tenses like a CAT,
EYES WIDENING.

                  (dreamlike)
             Come to Smeagol.

ANGLE ON: FRODO, head bowed, trying to pull himself up. He
doesn't notice GOLLUM'S HAND reaching for the RING !

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM'S FINGERS . . . closing in on the RING   ...

ANGLE ON: SAM, still TEETERING on the PRECIPITOUS STAIRS
DRAWS HIS SWORD!

                        SAM
                  (alarmed yell)
             Mr Frodo!

STARTLED, FRODO looks down at SAM, losing his footing in the
process . . .

                        SAM (cont'd)
             Get back, you. Don't touch him!

ANGLE ON: SAM'S horrified face as . . .

GOLLUM'S out-stretched HAND suddenly GRASPS FRODO'S ARM
pulling him SAFELY onto the LEDGE.

GOLLUM glares down at SAM.

                       GOLLUM
             Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has
             Smeagol ever done to him? Master?

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM blinks, masking the MALICE of his EYES with
their heavy pale lids.

           cannot know. Smeagol look after Master.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM creeps CLOSE to FRODO and WHISPERS in his
ear:

                  (rasping whisper)
           He   wants it - he needs it. Smeagol sees it

           it   - you will see . . . the Fat One will take
           it   from you.

CLOSE ON: FRODO looking at SAM . . . his hand strays to his
NECK, closing tight around the RING.

             I do not think we should so lightly abandon
             the outer defences; defences that your
             brother long held intact.

                        FARAMIR
             What would you have me do?

                       DENETHOR
             I will not yield the River and Pelennor
             unfought - Osgiliath must be retaken.

                        FARAMIR
             My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

                        DENETHOR
             Much must be risked in war. Is there a
             Captain here who still has the courage to
             do his Lord's will?

CLOSE ON: FARAMIR as he finally realises the truth.

                  (quietly)
             You wish now that our places had been

            Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do
            what I can in his stead.

SAM watches a sleeping GOLLUM suspiciously as he desperately
tries to stay awake. SLOWLY, INEVITABLY, SAM, falls asleep.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM'S EYES SNAP OPEN . . . he sits up and quietly
crawls towards SAM'S KNAPSACK.

SAM breathes deeply now, heavily asleep.

GOLLUM grimaces in DISTASTE as he pulls out the LEMBAS BREAD

                  (prevaricating)
             Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so
             polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that
             nobody else could find and they say
             "Sneak!", "Sneak!". Very nice friends, oh
             yes, my Precious, very nice.

                        SAM
             Alright, alright - you just startled me is

Too exhausted to argue, SAM turns away.

             Fine, have it your own way.

SAM gently shakes FRODO'S shoulder.                            -

            I don't want to keep it . . . I just want to
            help!

FRODO rises to his FEET, as if empowered with a frightening
intense ENERGY.

                       GOLLUM
            See! See! He wants it for himself.

                       SAM
                 (beside himself)
            Shut up, you! Go away. Get out of here.

            No, Sam . . . it's you.

            But . . . he's a liar . . . he's poisoned you
            against me.

                       FRODO
            You can't help me anymore.

                       SAM
            You don't mean that.

                       FRODO

                     FARAMIR
               (deadened)
          Where does my allegiance lie if not here?

GANDALF reads the PAIN in FARAMIR'S eyes . . . he calls after
him, trying one more time to stop the YOUNG MAN.

                     GANDALF
          Your father loves you, Faramir!

INT. TOWER HALL, MINAS TIRITH - DAY

FAST PUSH IN . . . to PIPPIN looking on as DENETHOR eats.

                      DENETHOR
           Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

                      PIPPIN
                (uneasy)
           Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my
           own people ... but we have no songs for
           great halls and evil times . . . we seldom
           sing of anything more terrible than wind or
           rain.

                      DENETHOR
           And why should your songs be unfit for my
           halls, or for hours such as these. Come -
           sing me a song!

PIPPIN'S simple, clear voice echoes through the VAST HALL.

                      PIPPIN V/0
           Home is behind, the world ahead,
           And there are many paths to tread.
           Through shadow to the edge of night
           Until the stars are all alight.
           Mist and shadow, cloud and shade:
           All shall fade, all shall fade.

             I bring five hundred men from the Westfold,
             my Lord.

                        ROHAN MARSHALL (0.S.)
             We have three hundred more from Fenmarch,
             Theoden, King.

THEODEN smiles grimly as he rides on.

                        DENETHOR
                  (quietly)
             Where are the riders from Snowbourne?

             None have come, My Lord.

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DUSK

ARAGORN joins THEODEN on a BLUFF overlooking the ENCAMPMENT
BELOW ...

CAMERA CRANES to REVEAL: THOUSANDS of MEN and HORSES! Smoke

TWILIGHT HAZE.

                         THEODEN
                  (quietly)
             Six thousand spears . . . less than half of
             what I had hoped for . . .

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to THEODEN ...

                       ARAGORN
             Six thousand will not be enough to break
             the lines of Mordor.

                     THEODEN
          More will come.

CLOSE ON: THEODEN realising what ARAGORN is saying - no

THEODEN nods.

The HORSES whinny loudly in the distance ... THEODEN looks up
at the MOUNTAIN which looms behind them . . .

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DUSK

ANGLE ON: HORSES rearing in terror as ROHAN SOLDIERS try to
quieten them ...

ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS and GIMLI move through the CAMP . . .

CLOSE ON: LEGOLAS looking at a group of ROHAN SOLDIERS . . .
they sit quiet and hunched ... no-one speaking ...

LEGOLAS looking toward EOMER who is unsaddling his HORSE ...

                        LEGOLAS
                  (uneasy)
             The horses are restless . . . And the men are -;.

             They grow nervous in the shadow of the
             mountain . . .

GIMLI'S eyes travel to a ROW of ANCIENT STANDING STONES that
mark the ENTRANCE to a ROAD leading away from the ENCAMPMENT
and INTO the MOUNTAIN.

                       GIMLI
             That road there - where does that lead?

                       LEGOLAS
             It is the road to the Dimholt ... The door
             under the mountain.

             That mountain is evil . . .

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN stands before the road as though transfixed
... before him a HORSE whinnies and pulls at his ropes
nervously . . .

STRAP.

                        EOWYN
             There! A true Esquire of Rohan.

MERRY exhales - excited and terrified in equal measure. In
his EXCITEMENT, he draws his SWORD ...

EOWYN steps back, laughing ...

                        MERRY
             Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous.

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

As EOWYN and MERRY leave the tent, EOMER and GAMLING are

             To the Smithy .- go!

MERRY hurries off    . . . EOMER watches the YOUNG HOBBIT leave.

                        EOMER
             You should not encourage him.

                        EOWYN
             And you should not doubt him.

                        EOMER
             I do not doubt his heart ... Only the reach
             of his arm.

             I choose a mortal life . . . I wish I could

As ARWEN lies dying, the EVENSTAR falls from her fingers ...
At that moment, ARAGORN wakes, his SWORD quickly in his HAND

ANGLE ON: THEODEN bows slightly to the HOODED FIGURE and
LEAVES, shooting ARAGORN a strange look as he goes ...

CLOSE ON: The FIGURE stands and pulls back the HOOD . . . to

             She will not long survive the evil that now
             spreads from Mordor.

ELROND'S eyes fall to the EVENSTAR which hangs around
ARAGORN'S neck . . .

                        ELROND (cont'd)
             The light of the Evenstar is failing. As
             Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.
             Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the
             Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn, the
             end has come.

                       ARAGORN
             It will not be our end, but his.

                         ELROND
             You ride to war, but not to victory.
             Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith -
             this you know - but in secret he sends
             another force which will attack from the

             They will be in the city in two days . . .
             You're out-numbered, Aragorn. You need more
             men.

A SUDDEN WIND rushes through the TENT, lifting HANGINGS,
scattering MAPS, knocking over GOBLETS . . .

As ARAGORN looks at ELROND, an IMAGE FLASHES in his MIND'S
EYE . . . The GHOSTLY FIGURE on the DIMHOLT ROAD . . .

ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock . . .

                    ARAGORN
          Murderers, traitors - you would call upon
          them to fight? They believe in nothing.
          They answer to no-one.

                     ELROND
          They will answer to the King of Condor.

ARAGORN' S eyes fall to a PLAIN BLACK SCABBARD, which ELROND
draws from beneath his robes.

CLOSE ON: ELROND' S long white fingers draw the hilt of a
SWORD from the scabbard to reveal . . . a ELVEN SWORD glints in

ARAGORN takes the sword . . . staring at it in wonder.

          Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of

ARAGORN draws the long blade from its sheath . . .

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: As ARAGORN readies BREGO for leaving EOWYN
approaches ... her temper barely held in check.

                       EOWYN
            Why are you doing this?

ARAGORN looks over his shoulder at her . . .

                      EOWYN (cont'd)
            The war lies to.the East. You cannot leave
            on the eve of battle. You cannot abandon         ;
            the men.

                          ARAGORN
            Eowyn . . .

ARAGORN rounds on her ...

                       ARAGORN
             Why have you come?

                  (hesitant)
             Do you not know?

ARAGORN looks at her sadly, not wanting to hurt her.

                        ARAGORN
                  (gentle)
             It is but a shadow and a thought that you
             love . . . I cannot give you what you seek.

EOWYN steps back at though STRUCK . . . she watches stricken as
ARAGORN leaves . . .

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU'- NIGHT

the DIMHOLT ROAD.

A LIGHT FLARES ahead.of him . . .

hand.

                        GIMLI
             And just where do you think you're off to?

ARAGORN looks at GIMLI - GRATEFUL for his COURAGE but
determined to go ALONE.

                        ARAGORN
             Not this time ... This time you must stay,
             my friend.

                        LEGOLAS O.S
             Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness
             of Dwarves?

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks at LEGOLAS as he appears, leading his
HORSE - already SADDLED.

             You might as well accept it - we're going
             with you, laddie.

ARAGORN shakes his head, smiling his acceptance.

ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI ... ROHAN SOLDIERS emerge from
their tents, crestfallen to see ARAGORN leave.

ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI disappear into the SHADOWS of the
MOUNTAINS. The ROHAN SOLDIERS murmur among themselves,
"What's happening?", "Where's he going?"

                    GAMLING
          Lord Aragorn!

                    ROHAN SOLDIER O.S.
          Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

                    GAMLING
          He leaves because there is no hope.

CLOSE ON: THEODEN as he moves forward.

                    THEODEN
          He leaves because he must.

                     GAMLING
          Too few have come. We cannot defeat the
          armies of Mordor.

                      THEODEN
          No, we cannot . . .
               (surveying his frightened Men)
          But we will meet them in battle,
          nonetheless.

EXT. THEODEN'S TENT, DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DAWN

ANGLE ON: THEODEN looks at EOWYN who stands as if turned to
stone ... she is looking up at a LIGHTENING SKY ... The QUIET
before the MEN depart for WAR . . .

                      THEODEN
                (gentle)
           I have left instruction: the people are to
           follow your rule in my stead ... take up my
           seat in the Golden Hall ... long may you
           defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.

ANGLE ON: EOWYN turns to the KING ... her FACE a BLANK ...
She speaks without emotion.

                      EOWYN
           What other duty would you have me do, my
           Lord?

THEODEN moves towards her, taking up her HAND . . .

                     THEODEN
               (quiet)
           Duty? ... No, I would have you smile again -
           not grieve for those whose time has come.

EOWYN slowly lifts her head . . .

                     THEODEN (cont'd)
           You shall live to see these days renewed.

CLOSE ON: THEODEN lifts EOWYN faces to look into her EYES . . .

             What kind of an army would linger in such a
             place?

                       LEGOLAS
             One that is cursed ... Long ago the Men of
             the Mountain swore an oath to the last King
             of Condor - to come to his aid, to fight,
             but when the time came, when Condor's need
             was dire, they fled ... Vanishing into the
             darkness of the mountain ... And so Isildur
             cursed them - never to rest until they had
             fulfilled their pledge.

SILENCE surrounds them, there are no birds, no wind. Only the
OMINOUSLY MUFFLED THUD of their horses hooves on the dank FIR-
NEEDLES.                                     '

EXT. DIMHOLT GLEN - DAY

ANGLE ON: Before them, at the ROOT OF THE MOUNTAIN, a SHEER
WALL of ROCK towers . . .

                     GIMLI
               (terrified whisper)
          The very warmth of my blood seems stolen
          away.

Within the walls, a creepy DARK DOOR gapes like a mouth of
night. SIGNS and FIGURES are carved above its WIDE ARCH.

                     LEGOLAS
               (translating)
          The way is shut. It was made by those who
          are dead, and the Dead keep it. The way is
          shut.

AT THAT MOMENT: A CHILL WIND seems to rush out of the DOORWAY
. . . ARAGORN stares into the BLACKNESS, his HAIR BLOWING
WILDLY. The HORSES REAR and'BUCK'in terror, turning and
GALLOPING AWAY.

                       ARAGORN

LEGOLAS quickly follows . . . swallowed by the DARKNESS.

CLOSE ON: GIMLI left ALONE . . . He hesitates, struggling with hi
FEAR.

                         GIMLI
             Well, this is a thing unheard of ... An Elf
             will go underground when a Dwarf dare not.
                  (gritting his teeth)
             Oh! I ' d never hear the end of it!

GIMLI plunges into the TUNNEL behind the OTHERS!

                     THEODEN
          We must ride light and swift. It's a long
          road ahead ... and man and beast must reach
          the end with the strength to fight.

ANGLE ON: MERRY . . . preparing a LITTLE PONY with a SADDLE and
SUPPLIES. He is wearing an OVERSIZED HELMET and ROHIRRIM
CLOTHING . . . he looks at once NERVOUS and EXCITED.

KING THEODEN breaks away from a COLUMN and rides up to MERRY.

                        THEODEN
             It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith.
             None of my Riders can bear you as a burden.

                         MERRY
             But . . . I want to fight!

                        THEODEN
             I will say no more.

KING THEODEN wheels his HORSE away . . .

MERRY is bitterly DISAPPOINTED. He stands, head down - a TINY
DEJECTED FIGURE - as the MIGHTY ROHIRRIM on their LARGE
HORSES ride by . . . a jangling sea of HELMETS, SHIELDS and
BANNERS.

SUDDENLY . . . MERRY is plucked off the ground! A SOLDIER has
snatched him by the collar ... and plonked him down on their
SADDLE!

CLOSE ON: MERRY twists around, looking up at the SOLDIER . . .
Beneath a HELMET and MAIL HOOD is . . .

SPIDER . . . towering over FRODO!

CLOSE ON: SHELOB the SPIDER HISSES at the LIGHT! TWO great
clusters of many-windowed EYES protrude from her bulbous
head. Her LEGS are bent, with a 12 FOOT SPAN and HAIRS that
stick out like steel spines. Her HUGE, SWOLLEN BODY, a vast
bloated bag, sways and sags between her legs. Her age-old
BLACK HIDE is knobbly and pitted, blotchy with LIVID MARKS

SHELOB beats the air with her FORELEGS.

ANGLE ON: Calling up all his remaining STRENGTH and
RESOLUTION, FRODO forces his LEGS to MOVE . . . he backs away -
keeping his EYES on SHELOB.

SHELOB crawls SLOWLY towards him ... then, with sudden .
hideous SPEED, she ATTACKS!

She lashes out with her FRONT LEGS ... FRODO is flung back
... the GLASS PHIAL clatters to the TUNNEL FLOOR, casting an
eerie LOW LIGHT.

SHELOB squats above FRODO, her EYE CLUSTERS fidgeting with
hideous delight, gloating over a prey trapped beyond all hope
of escape.

SUDDENLY! FRODO draws STING! He slashes wildly at the GIANT
SPIDER . . . hewing off the TIP of A LEG!

SHELOB SPASMS . . . a WILD BLUR of thrashing LEGS!

to pick up the PHIAL of LIGHT!

TUNNELS, gasping in the CHOKING AIR ... looking back over his
shoulder for any sign of SHELOB.

himself ... STING is caught in the WEB ... FRODO leaves the

FRODO pins GOLLUM on the ground, hands around his throat.

ANGLE ON: FRODO'S fingers squeeze tighter around GOLLUM'S
THROAT.

             Smeagol promised. You must believe us. It
             was the Precious - the Precious made us to
             do it.

FRODO has a sudden moment of SELF REALISATION and releases
GOLLUM, horrified at his VIOLENCE.

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM cowering back . . . COUGHING and SPLUTTERING.

             I have to destroy it, Smeagol. I have to
             destroy it for both our sakes.

SMEAGOL stares at FRODO in DISBELIEF . . . in a FURY he LUNGES
at FRODO who falls backwards, dangerously close to the edge
of the PRECIPICE - GOLLUM tumbles over FRODO's BODY and FALLS
to the bottom of the RAVINE ...

EXT. PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL - NIGHT

FRODO, overcome with EXHAUSTION, stumbles down the steep
stairs of CIRITH UNGOL . . . He is full of REMORSE at his
TREATMENT of SAM ...

ANGLE ON: An IRON DOOR creaks OPEN . . . FARAMIR'S PROCESSION
enters a WIDE VAULTED CHAMBER.

The LANTERN LIG HT throws great SHADOWS upon the SHROUDED
WALLS of a wide  VAULTED CHAMBER. ROW upon ROW of MARBLE TOMBS
are visible in  the DIM LIGHT. Upon each TOMB lies a SLEEPING
FORM, carved in  STONE, hands folded.

DENETHOR speaks in a HUSHED VOICE . . .

                       DENETHOR
                (whisper)
           No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long
           slow sleep of death embalmed . . . we shall
           burn - like the heathen kings of old!

The SERVANTS place FARAMIR'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY on a STONE
TABLE in the centre of the CHAMBER. They stand, heads bowed
. . . as MOURNERS beside a bed of death.

DENETHOR turns to his SERVANTS.

STEALTH, she follows FRODO ...

SPINS AROUND: Before he can react, SHELOB VICIOUSLY STABS
FRODO in the NECK with her monstrous abdominal STINGER!

GREEN OOZE trickling from her WOUNDED EYE.

With HIND LEGS, SHELOB picks SAM off the ground and TOSSES
him BACKWARDS! SAM lands heavily . . . and SHELOB POUNCES!

ANGLE ON: SHELOB heaves the great bag of her BELLY high above
SAM'S HEAD. As she splays her legs to drive her huge bulk
down on him, SAM lifts the ELVEN BLADE above his head,
holding it with TWO HANDS.

STING slides into SHELOB'S SOFT UNDERBELLY! A SHUDDER runs
through her! HEAVING up. again, she wrenches herself away from
the PAIN ... her LIMBS writhing beneath her.

ANGLE ON: JERKING and QUIVERING, SHELOB crawls to her HOLE,

EXT. PELENNOR FIELDS, MINAS TIRITH - DAY

WIDE ON: PELENNOR FIELDS . . . strangely SILENT . . . all ORCS
have fled ... BATTLE DEBRIS and BODIES stretch as far as the
eye can see...

ABOVE MINAS TIRITH ... BLINDING SUN RAYS break through the
LOW CLOUDS!

ANGLE ON: GANDALF, LEGOLAS, GIMLI and PIPPIN watch as . . .
ARAGORN walks slowly across the FIELD OF BATTLE towards the
HIDEOUS GHOULS ...

                       KING OF THE DEAD
            Release us.

                       GIMLI
                 (quietly)
            Bad idea. Very handy in a tight spot, these
            lads - despite the fact, they're dead!

                      KING OF THE DEAD
            You gave us your word.

                       ARAGORN
            I hold your oath fulfilled . . . Go. Be at
            peace.

ANGLE ON: The ARMY OF THE DEAD slowly DISSOLVE INTO DUST, and
are immediately swept away by the four winds.

ARAGORN turns to GANDALF who bows his head in HOMAGE ...

PIPPIN, in his GONDORIAN armour, looks around at the
devastation ... his eyes full of SADNESS ... they suddenly
fix on something.

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN running through the RUIN of the BATTLE . . .
towards a SMALL FIGURE slumped on the ground ...

                          PIPPIN
             Merry ...?

MERRY stares unseeing at PIPPIN ... HORROR and SHOCK erasing
all other memories from MERRY'S mind ... tears fall down
PIPPIN'S FACE as he looks on his FRIEND . . .

TILT UP . . . to reveal the ORC and URUK-HAI, GORBAG and
SHAGRAT, arguing over FRODO'S BELONGINGS and CLOTHES! GORBAG
is snatching for the MITHRIL VEST.

                        SHAGRAT
             Hey! Hands off - that shiny shirt, that's
             mine.

                         GORBAG
             It's going to the Great Eye, along with
             everything else . . .

ANGLE ON . . . FRODO as he realizes that he has been STRIPPED
down to his UNDERWEAR. He clutches at his throat.

... The RING HAS GONE!

             I don't take orders from stinking Morgul

GORBAG grabs for the MITHRIL VEST ...

             You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in

SEVERAL URUK-HAI are running DOWN TOWARDS HIM! He grips STING

lungs!

terror back to the top of the stairs!

SAM appears - and before the URUK-HAI can fully regain their

INT. TOWER OF CIRITH UNGOL/TOP ROOM - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: FRODO struggling against his bonds, as GORBAG
climbs back into the room ... with VENGEANCE in his EVIL
EYES.

                      GORBAG
           Stop your squeaking you dunghill rat!

FRODO'S throat . . .

SAM pulls the RING from his pocket ...

             I thought I ' d lost you . . . so I took it -

                        FRODO
             Give it to me.

SAM hesitates . . . . TENSION instantly builds between them.

             Give me the Ring, Sam.

SAM seems strangely reluctant . . . ON THE SOUNDTRACK to HUM of

FRODO looks at SAM, pain in his eyes ...

SAM looks down at FRODO ... his plain HOBBIT face full of
compassion. SAM'S resolve hardens, a new strength takes hold.

EXT. PASS OF CIRITH UN.GOL - NIGHT

FRODO and SAM are now dressed in FOUL-LOOKING ORC gear ...

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM turn east and walk over the SUMMIT of
CIRITH UNGOL ... into MORDOR.

CLOSE ON: FRODO and SAM . . . they STOP DEAD . . . STARING AHEAD:

ANGLE ON: MOUNT DOOM . . . 50 M,ILES AWAY - across the barren
GORGOROTH PLATEAU - the mountain is erupting streams of ASH
and LAVA high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of
MORDOR with a flickering ORANGE WASH.

With immense trepidation, FRODO and SAM head down the steep
path into the dark kingdom . . .

. . . TWO TINY FIGURES in a bleak, foreboding landscape. Before
them lies the PLAIN of GORGOROTH ... Their eyes are drawn to
the OMINOUS SILHOUETTE of MOUNT DOOM ...

                      SAM
           We did it, Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor.

ANGLE ON: FRODO's eyes travel down towards the HUNDREDS of
FIRES which glow on the PLAINS beneath them ... thousands
upon thousands of ORCS are encamped there .

                      FRODO
           There are so many of them . . . So many.
           We'll never get through unseen.

THEIR eyes are drawn to a DARK LOOMING SHAPE ... BARAD-DUR
. . . A RED LIGHT seems to sweep across the PLAIN ...

                      FRODO (cont'd)
               (terror)
           It's him - the Eye.

The GREAT EYE OF SAURON!

SAM cannot see what FRODO sees. GENTLY, he urges FRODO on.

                       SAM
             We have to go in there, Mr Frodo. There's
             nothing for it. Come on. Let's just make it
             down the hill for starters.

EXT. MINAS TIRITH, TOWER HALL - DAY

CLOSE ON: GANDALF stands in the TOWER HALL . . . seemingly
alone . . . he speaks quietly, doubt and fear edge his voice.

                        GANDALF
             Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The
             darkness is deepening.

He turns and crosses the HALL to reveal the presence of
GIMLI, LEGOLAS, EOMER and ARAGORN . . .

ARAGORN, his back to GANDALF . . .

                       ARAGORN
             If Sauron had the .Ring, we would know it.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF - still troubled, still worried . . .

                    GANDALF
          It's only a matter of time. He has suffered
          a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of
          Mordor our enemy is regrouping.

GIMLI sits insolently on the SEAT of the STEWARD . . .

                    GIMLI
          Let him stay there. Let him rot. Why should
          we care?

GANDALF looks across at the DWARF . . . His face ashen.

                    GANDALF
          Because ten thousand Ores now stand between
          Frodo and Mount Doom.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns around suddenly . . .

                        ARAGORN
             No.

GANDALF looks up sharply at ARAGORN . . .

                       ARAGORN (cont'd)
             There is still hope for Frodo. He needs
             time and safe passage across the Plains of
             Gorgoroth. We can give him that.

                        GANDALF
             How?

                        ARAGORN
             Draw out Sauron' s armies - empty his lands.
             Then we gather our full strength and march
             on the Black Gate.

At this, GIMLI CHOKES on his pipe . . . EOMER steps forward.

                        EOMER
             We cannot achieve victory from strength of
             arms .

                        ARAGORN
             Not for ourselves . . . But we can give Frodo
             his chance if we keep Sauron' s eye fixed
             upon us. Keep him blind to all else that
             moves .

                         LEGOLAS
             A diversion . . .

                  (doubtful)
             Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not
             take the bait!

marching away from MT. DOOM . . .

ARAGORN'S FORCE of 500 approaches the great BLACK GATES OF

             Take mine . . . there's a few drops left.

             There'll be none left for the return

EXT. PLAINS OF GORGOROTH - DAY

WIDE ON: FRODO and SAM staggering across the TORTURED
LANDSCAPE ... they are no longer WEARING the ORC ARMOUR.

CLOSE ON: FRODO is walking half-bowed, often stumbling . . . as
if his eyes not longer see the way before his feet.

His right HAND is pressed against his CHEST ... supporting a
HEAVY WEIGHT. His left HAND often rises, as if to ward off

                       GANDALF
             Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now
             finished. Here at last, on the shores of
             the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship.

There is GREAT SADNESS . . . MERRY SNIFFLES LOUDLY.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             I will not say: "do not weep", for not all
             tears are an evil.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF turns and walks away . . . FRODO is DOWNCAST
... SUDDENLY, GANDALF turns and looks toward him.

                      GANDALF (cont'd)
           It is time, Frodo.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks at FRODO then turns and slowly walks
towards the GANGPLANK to board the SHIP.

                      SAM
                (alarmed)
           What does he mean?

CLOSE ON: FRODO turns to SAM. . . .

                       FRODO
                (gently)
           We set out to save the Shire, and it has
           been saved ... but not for me . . .

                       SAM
                (shaken)
           You don't mean that - you can't leave.

ANGLE ON: SAM looks down . . . FRODO is holding BILBO'S RED
JOURNAL out towards him.

                      FRODO
           The last pages are for you, Sam.

SAM is SOBBING . . . MERRY and PIPPIN are DISTRAUGHT . . . .

FRODO hugs MERRY and PIPPIN, and last of all SAM . . . and
climbs on board the SHIP.

ANGLE ON: FRODO a look of WONDERMENT crosses his face . . . as
he STEPS FORWARD and ACCEPTS GANDALF'S HAND . . . finally
released from his pain, care falls from his face . . . he is
the young FRODO we first met so long ago.

SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN comfort each other as the WHITE SHIP
glides away from the DOCK ...

WIDE ON: The WHITE BOAT sails away towards the HEADLANDS,
disappearing into the GOLDEN LIGHT of the SETTING SUN.

ANGLE ON: SAM in growing darkness, still follows the
departing SHIP with his eyes, MERRY and PIPPIN are already
preparing to leave.

ANGLE ON: SAM walks up the path towards his house . . .

A LITTLE GIRL toddles up to greet him.

                       SAM
            Elanor!

He hugs his daughter . . .

                       FRODO V/0
            My dear Sam. You cannot always be torn in
            two. You have to be one and whole for many
            years. You have so much enjoy and to be and
            to do. Because Sam, your part in the
            journey goes on.

ANGLE ON: ROSIE COTTON steps up and kisses SAM on the cheek
. . . she gives him a TINY BABY BOY to cradle.

                       SAM
            Hello, little Frodo!

ANGLE ON: SAM with his FAMILY . . . he draws a deep breath:

                      SAM (cont'd)
           Well ... I'm back.

SAM looks at his LOVELY FAMILY with GREAT HAPPINESS, tinged
with a little SADNESS . . .

SAM and ROSIE take the CHILDREN'S HANDS and enter BAGSHOT . . .
the BRIGHT YELLOW DOORWAY closes behind them.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. HOBBITON - DAY

WIDE ON: The sun rises over the village of HOBBITON. A
dense, orange glow is cast against the LITTLE RIVERS and
ROLLING HILLS.

EXT. BAG END - HOBBITON - DAY
2
CLOSE ON: A SMOKE RING floats in the morning sky. It wavers
gently in the wind, tranquil.
Suddenly, it collapses with a POP and transforms into a
SMOKE MOTH.
The moth FLUTTERS into the face of curly-haired hobbit BILBO
BAGGINS. The puff of smoke wakes him from his reverie. He
notices a grey figure standing in front of him.
WIDE ON: The wizard GANDALF THE GREY stands before Bilbo's
FENCE, watching.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo seems startled.
BILBO
Good morning.
GANDALF
What do you mean? Do you mean to
wish me a good morning, or do you
mean that it is a good morning
whether I want it or not? Or,
perhaps you mean to say that you
feel good on this particular
morning, or are you simply stating
that this is a morning to be good
on?
BILBO
All of them at once, I suppose?
Gandalf gives Bilbo a disapproving look. Bilbo looks simply
bewildered.

BILBO (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, can I help you?
GANDALF
That remains to be seen. I'm
looking for someone to share in an
adventure.
Bilbo's PIPE drops from his mouth.
BILBO
An adventure? Now I don't imagine
anyone west of Bree would have much
interest in adventures. Nasty,
disturbing, uncomfortable things.
Make you late for dinner!
WIDE ON: Bilbo gets up and checks his mailbox.
ANGLE ON: He grabs some LETTERS and ENVELOPES and sorts
through them. After sparing Gandalf a brief glance, he turns
to leave.
BILBO (CONT'D)
Good morning.
GANDALF
To think that I should have lived
to be good-morninged by Belladonna
Took's son as if I were selling
buttons at the door.
Bilbo whips around, startled at the mention of his mother.
BILBO
Beg your pardon?
GANDALF
You've changed, and not entirely
for the better, Bilbo Baggins.
BILBO
I'm sorry, do I know you?
GANDALF
Well, you know my name, although
you don't remember I belong to it.
I'm Gandalf and Gandalf means me!
A look of recognition flashes across Bilbo's face. His lips
curl into a smile.

BILBO
Not Gandalf, the wandering wizard,
who made such excellent fireworks!
Old Took used to have them on
Mid-Summer's Eve!
(beat)
I had no idea you were still in
business.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf gives Bilbo a scathing look.
GANDALF
And where else should I be?
BILBO
Well...
Bilbo's voice awkwardly TRAILS OFF. Sheepish, Bilbo takes
another whiff of his pipe.
GANDALF
Well, I'm pleased to find you
remember something about me, even
if it's only my fireworks. Well
then, that's decided. It will be
very good for you and most amusing
for me. I shall inform the others.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo grows pale with shock. He retreats further
towards Bag End.
BILBO
Inform the who? What? No, no, no!
We do not want any adventures here,
thank you! Not today! I suggest you
try somewhere over the hill or
across the water! Good morning!
In frustration, Bilbo storms into his home.

INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - DAY
WIDE ON: Bilbo bolts the door shut behind him. Relieved, he
leans on it, catching his breath.
Suddenly, he hears a mysterious SCRAPPING NOISE on his door.
Bilbo listens closely, WONDERING.

Bilbo's door with the edge of his STAFF.

INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - DAY

Alarmed, Bilbo rushes to his window. He peers outside and
sees nothing but blue sky.
Suddenly, Gandalf's EYE is staring back at him through the
glass. Bilbo jumps back in fright, hiding out of sight.
Gandalf lingers outside the window, before turning and
leaving. Bilbo reenters the hallway and looks out of the
window. He sees Gandalf hurrying away from Bag End.
6
EXT. MARKETPLACE - HOBBITON - DAY
6
WIDE ON: Bilbo scurries toward the marketplace, a crazed
look in his eyes.
Numerous TENTS AND PAVILIONS are set up around the market.
Under their roofs, FOOD, DRINK, AND OTHER ITEMS are sold.
DOZENS OF HOBBITS waltz around the site, CHATTERING amongst
themselves. The women laugh, the men drink and the children
play.
ANGLE ON: A FISHERHOBBIT hands Bilbo his PACKAGED GOODS.
BILBO
Thank you.
Bilbo hurries away from the marketplace, eager to return
home. Just to be sure, Bilbo peers over his shoulder.
Nothing is there.
He looks back to the road before him, finding an elderly
hobbit, MASTER WORRYWORT, wheeling a cart towards him.
Worrywort pauses when he sees Bilbo.
WORRYWORT
Hello, Mr. Bilbo! Here!
Worrywort holds up a LARGE, ROUND PLANT in front of Bilbo.
WORRYWORT (CONT'D)
Have a feel of me tubers. Nice and
firm they are. Just came in from
West Farthing!
Bilbo gives the plant a brief touch.

BILBO
Very impressive, Master Worrywort.
Now, I don't suppose you've seen a
wizard lurking about these parts?
WORRYWORT
Tall fellow, long grey beard,
pointy hat. Can't say I have.
As Worrywort speaks, Bilbo spots the TIP OF A GREY HAT
moving behind a tent.
He sprints away from the marketplace, leaving Worrywort
behind. Bilbo hides himself next to a STONE BRIDGE, watching
as the hat makes its way past the tent.
The hat rounds a corner. It was only a BASKET OF GREY WOOL.
Bilbo steps out from the bridge, dazed.

HOBBIT stumbles past Bag End, carrying a FLAGON OF WINE in
his hand.

INT. KITCHEN - BAG END - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: Two fish SIZZLE on a frying pan.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo loads them onto his plate, dressed in his
night-time robes. He settles down at the table, tucks a
napkin into his collar and begins to season his meal.

dwarf, DWALIN, standing at his doorstep. He greets Bilbo
with a slight bow.

DWALIN
Dwalin, at your service.
Bilbo lets out a CONFUSED WHIMPER. Coming to his senses, he
quickly ties his robe together and stands taller, but the
confused look on his face still remains.
BILBO
Bilbo Baggins, at yours.
Dwalin steps inside without invitation.
BILBO (CONT'D)
Sorry, do we know each other?
DWALIN
No. Which way, laddie? Is it down
here?
BILBO
Is what down where?
Dwalin takes off his COAT and throws it to Bilbo. The poor
hobbit barely manages to catch the thing.
DWALIN
Supper. He said there'd be food and
lots of it.
The dwarf strides down the hallway, as if it were his own.
Bilbo stares after him, befuddled.
BILBO
He said? Who said?
12
INT. KITCHEN - BAG END - NIGHT
12
Dwalin sits at Bilbo's spot at the table, scarfing down the
fish. Bilbo watches him eat, disgusted.
CLOSE ON: Dwalin scarfs down all the flesh off from the
fish. He drops the BONES onto the plate, wiping his hands on
his beard.
DWALIN
Very good, this. Any more?
BILBO
What? Oh, yes.

He manages to hide one behind his back for himself.
Dwalin grabs most of the biscuits and stuffs them down his
mouth.
BILBO (CONT'D)
It's just that I wasn't expecting
company.
CLOSE ON: The DOORBELL RINGS once again. Bilbo looks up in
alarm.
DWALIN
That'll be the door.
Dwalin stares up at him, GREASE staining his beard.
13
INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT
13
ANGLE ON: Bilbo opens the door once again. He finds another
dwarf standing before him. BALIN. The much older dwarf gives
a ginger bow.
BALIN
Balin, at your service.
BILBO
Good evening.
BALIN
Yes, yes, it is. Though, I think it
might rain later. Am I late?
BILBO
Late for what?
Balin spots Dwalin in the hallway, trying to get more
biscuits from the JAR.
BALIN
Oh! Evening brother!
Dwalin puts the jar down with a smile. The two brothers
approach each other.
DWALIN
By my beard, you are shorter and
wider than last we met.

BALIN
Wider, not shorter. But sharp
enough for the both of us.
CLOSE ON: The two share a CHUCKLE as Bilbo looks on,
confused.
14
INT. PANTRY - BAG END - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: Dwalin and Balin have gone into the pantry,
helping themselves to ALE and examining the FOOD.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo steps into the room.
BILBO
It's not that I don't like
visitors, I like visitors as much
as the next hobbit. But I do like
to know them before they come
visiting.
ANGLE ON: The dwarves continue to riffle through the pantry,
ignoring their host.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo sheepishly presses on.
BILBO (CONT'D)
The thing is, I don't know any of
you. Not in the slightest. I don't
mean to be blunt, but I had to
speak my mind. I'm sorry.
Dwalin and Balin pause and look at Bilbo.
BALIN
Apology accepted.
Bilbo nods, satisfied.
ANGLE ON:
Balin hands a TANKARD to his brother.
BALIN (CONT'D)
Now, fill it up, brother, don't
stint!
From the hallway, the DOORBELL RINGS once again. Bilbo
slowly turns around, at awe with shock.

ANGLE ON: For the third time, Bilbo opens the door. He finds
two young dwarves, FILI and KILI, standing before him. Bilbo
GROANS.
FILI
Fili.
KILI
And Kili.
(with Fili)
At your service.
They both give a courteous bow.
KILI (CONT'D)
You must be Mr. Boggins!
BILBO
Nope, you can't come in, you've
come to the wrong house.
Bilbo tries to close the door. Kili manages to stop it with
his feet.
KILI
Has it been cancelled?
FILI
No one told us!
BILBO
Cancelled? No, nothing's been
cancelled!
KILI
That's a relief!
The dwarves push their way in and begin to unload their
WEAPONS onto Bilbo.
FILI
Careful with these. We just had
them sharpened.
Kili admires the architecture of the hallway.
KILI
It's nice, this place. Did you do
it yourself?

Kili begins to scrape the mud off his boots on the edge of a
NEARBY CHEST.
BILBO (CONT'D)
That's my mother's glory box, could
you please not do that!
Dwalin enters the hallway and beckons Fili and Kili forward.
DWALIN
Fili, Kili, come on, give us a
hand!
KILI
Mr. Dwalin!
The two brothers follow Dwalin down the hall and into the
dining room. Bilbo begins to follow behind them, at a loss
for words.
BALIN (O.S.)
Let's shove this in the hallway,
otherwise we'll never get everyone
in.
BILBO
Everyone? How many more are there.
BALIN (O.S.)
Not many.
The DOORBELL RINGS AGAIN!
Enraged, Bilbo quickly walks to the door. Along the way, he
dumps the swords and equipment he is carrying onto the
ground.
BILBO
No! There's nobody home! Go away
and bother somebody else! There's
far too many dwarves in my dining
room as it is. If this is some
clotterd's idea of a joke, I can
only say that it is in very poor
taste.

INT. PANTRY - BAG END - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: The dwarves raid Bilbo's pantry. CHEESE, MEAT,
WINE, VEGGIES, FRUITS; every food under the sun. And they
are all wrenched from the PANTRY SHELVES.
17
INT. HALLWAY - BAG END - NIGHT
WIDE ON: Bilbo steps into the hall, seeing the dwarves cross
from pantry to dining room and back again. He steps forward.
BILBO
Excuse me, that's my chicken! Oh,
not my wine! Put that back! Put
that back!
ANGLE ON: Gloin and Fili pass Bilbo. Gloin carries THREE
WHEELS OF CHEESE.
BILBO (CONT'D)
That's a tad excessive, don't you
think? Do you have a cheese knife?
FILI
Cheese knife? He eats it by the
block.
Bilbo turns his attention to Oin, who carries WOODEN CHAIRS
at his side.
BILBO
No, that's Grandpa Mungo's chair!
Oin holds up a METAL TRUMPET to his ear.
OIN
I can't hear what you're saying,
laddie.
He manages to wrangle free of Bilbo and enters the dining
room.

BALIN
Excuse me, Gandalf, may I tempt you
with a cup of chamomile tea?
GANDALF
Oh, no thank you, Balin. A little
red wine for me, I think.
With a nod, Balin walks off. Gandalf exits the dining room,
ducking so as to not hit the doorway.

CLOSE ON: Gandalf walks into the central hub of the hallway.
He looks down, and starts to count the dwarves on his hands
as they pass by.
GANDALF
Fili, Kili, Oin, Gloin, Balin and
Dwalin. We appear to be one dwarf
short.
Dwalin lounges in a near corner.
DWALIN
He is late, is all. He travelled
North to a meeting of our kin. He
will come.
Balin approaches Gandalf, GLASS OF WINE in hand.
BALIN
As you requested, a glass of red
wine. It's got a fruity bouquet.
GANDALF
Cheers!
Gandalf gulps down the lush, red wine.

ANGLE ON: Kili enters the kitchen, using a DOILY to wipe his
face. Bilbo comes in behind him and rips the doily out of
Kili's hands.
BILBO
Excuse me, that is a doily, not a
dishcloth.
Fili lounges against the near fireplace.
FILI
But it's full of holes.
BILBO
It's supposed to look like that,
it's crochet.
FILI
Oh, and a wonderful game it is too,
if you've got the balls for it.
Kili LAUGHS at his brother's jest. Bilbo throws the doily
down onto the table, infuriated.
BILBO
Bebother and confusticate these
dwarves!
Gandalf enters the kitchen, concerned.

by dwarves! What are they doing
here?
Kili hoists a CHAIN OF SAUSAGES over his shoulder. Fili
grabs one end, trying to take them from him. Gandalf
observes the scuffle, amused.
GANDALF
They're quite a merry gathering,
once you get used to them.
BILBO
I don't want to get used to them!
Bilbo leads Gandalf into the hallway.

Bilbo points to a MUD SPLATTERED RUG.
BILBO
There's mud trod into the carpet,

not even going to tell you what
they've done in the bathroom;
they've all but destroyed the
plumbing! I don't understand what
they're doing in my house!
Balin approaches the pair, tapping Bilbo on the shoulder.
BALIN
Sorry, I hate to interrupt, but
where would you like me to put my
plate.
Fili enters the hallway.
FILI
Here you go, Balin, give it to me.
Fili takes the PLATE, quickly turning and throwing it to
Kili, standing at the doorway. Kili throws the dish into the

ANGLE ON: The door opens. There, standing on the doorstep,
is the noble looking THORIN OAKENSHIELD.
THORIN
Gandalf, I thought you said this
place would be easy to find. I lost
my way, twice. I wouldn't have
found it at all had it not been for
that mark on the door.
WIDE ON: Gandalf shuts the door behind Thorin. All the
dwarves bow at his presence. Bilbo pushes through the crowd,
entering the hall.
BILBO
Mark? There's no mark on that door,
it was pained a week ago.

GANDALF
There is a mark; I put it there
myself. Bilbo Baggins, allow me to
introduce the leader of our
company, Thorin Oakenshield.
ANGLE ON: Thorin steps towards Bilbo. There is STARK
JUDGEMENT in his eyes.
THORIN
So, this is the hobbit. Tell me,
Mr. Baggins, have you done much
fighting?
BILBO
Pardon me?
THORIN
Axe or sword? What is your weapon
of choice?
BILBO
Well, I do have some skill at
Conkers, if you must know, but I
fail to see why that's relevant.
THORIN
Thought as much. He looks more like
a grocer than a burglar.
The dwarves LAUGH at Thorin's jest. He gives them a warm
smile and walks himself down the hall.

INT. DINING ROOM - BAG END - NIGHT

The dwarves sit around the table with Thorin, who picks at
some SOUP. Gandalf sits beside him, smoking a pipe. Bilbo
watches from the doorway.
BALIN
What news from the meeting in Ered
Luin? Did they all come?
THORIN
Aye. Envoys from all seven
kingdoms.
The dwarves MURMUR IN EXCITEMENT.

What did the dwarves of the Iron
Hills say? Is Dain with us?
CLOSE ON: Thorin hesitates, frowning. All eyes are on him.
THORIN
They will not come.
ANGLE ON: The dwarves GASP and EXCLAIM in disappointment.
THORIN (CONT'D)
They say this quest is ours and
ours alone.
BILBO
You're going on a quest?
Bilbo looks to the dwarves, confused. Gandalf taps him on
the shoulder.
GANDALF
Bilbo, my dear fellow, let us have
a little more light.
Bilbo leaves the room and comes back with a CANDLE. He sets
it down near Gandalf, who has pulled out A MAP and is
spreading it across the table.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
Far to the east, over ranges and
rivers, beyond woodlands and
wastelands, lies a single solitary
peak.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf
LONELY MOUNTAIN.
points to a peak drawn on the map. THE
BILBO
The Lonely Mountain?
ANGLE ON: Bilbo peers down at the map.
CLOSE ON: He notices a RED DRAGON drawn beside the mountain.
GLOIN
Aye! Oin has read the portents and
the portents say it is time.

before.

OIN
Ravens have been seen flying back
to the mountain as it was foretold:
when the birds of yore return to
Erebor, the reign of the beast will
end.
Bilbo looks up from the map, concerned.
BILBO
What beast?
FILI
Well, that would be a reference to
Smaug the Terrible, chiefest and
greatest calamity of our age.
Airborne fire-breather, teeth like
razors, claws like meathooks.
Extremely fond of precious metals.
BILBO
Yes, I know what a dragon is.
BALIN
The task to win back the mountain
would be difficult enough with an
army behind us. But we number just
seven, and not seven of the best.
The dwarves object to this insult, SHOUTING RETORTS AND
PROTESTS.
GLOIN
We may be few in numbers, but we're
fighters. All of us, to the last
dwarf.
KILI
And you forget, we have a wizard in
our company. Gandalf must have
killed hundreds of dragons in his
time.
GANDALF
Well, no, I wouldn't say that I -

How many then?

FILI
How many dragons have you killed?
Go on, give us a number!
CLOSE ON: An embarrassed Gandalf starts to COUGH on his pipe
smoke. The dwarves GROAN, hopeless.
ANGLE ON: Thorin rises to his feet.
THORIN
If we have read these signs, do you
not think others will have read
them too? Rumours have begun to
spread. The dragon Smaug has not
been seen for sixty years. Eyes
look east to the mountain,
assessing, wondering, weighing the
risk. Perhaps the vast wealth of
our people now lies unprotected. Do
we sit back as others claim what is
rightfully ours? Or do we seize
this chance to take back Erebor?
Inspired by the speech, the dwarves JUMP AND CHEER. Balin
gets to his feet and RAISES HIS VOICE.
BALIN
You forget, the front gate is
sealed! There is no way into the
mountain.
GANDALF
That, my dear Balin, is not
entirely true.
CLOSE ON: With a twiddle of his fingers, Gandalf produces a
DWARVISH KEY, ornately wrought. Thorin looks at it in
wonder.
THORIN
How came you by this?
GANDALF
It was given to me by your father,
by Thrain, for safe keeping. It is
yours now.

in a proud astonishment.

These ruins speak of another
passage into the lower halls.
The wizard points to RUNES on the map.
FILI
There's another way in.
GANDALF
Well, if we can find it, but dwarf
doors are invisible when closed.
The answer lies hidden somewhere in
this map and I do not have the
skill to find it. But there are
others in Middle Earth who can.
The dwarves look to him, listening carefully.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
The task I have in mind will
require a great deal of stealth,
and no small amount of courage.
But, if we are careful and clever,
I believe that it can be done.
OIN
That's why we need a burglar.
BILBO
A good one too. An expert, I'd
imagine.
GLOIN
And are you?
Bilbo freezes, half confused, half afraid.
BILBO
Am I what?
OIN
He said he's an expert!

Me? No, no, no, I'm not a burglar.
I've never stolen a thing in my

BALIN
I'm afraid I have to agree with Mr.
Baggins. He's hardly burglar
material.
DWALIN
Aye, the wild is no place for
gentlefolk who can neither fight
nor fend for themselves.
Bilbo nods in desperate agreement, ignoring the insult.
Gandalf shakes his head, irritated.
GANDALF
Hobbits are remarkably light on
their feet! In fact, they can go
unseen by most if they choose. And
while the dragon is accustomed to
the smell of dwarf, the scent of a
hobbit is all but unknown to him
which gives us a distinct
advantage.
ANGLE ON: Gandalf turns to Thorin, determined to make his
point.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
You asked me to find the eighth
member of this company and I have
chosen Mr. Baggins. There's a lot
more to him than appearances
suggest, and he's got a great deal
to offer than any of you know,
including himself. You must trust
me on this.
Thorin SIGHS. He scans the room, weighing the outcome.
THORIN
Very well, we'll do it your way.

Give him our contract.

Funeral arrangements?
Bilbo takes the contract reluctantly. He unrolls the scroll,
which nearly reaches the floor.
BILBO (CONT'D)
Terms: cash on delivery, up to, but
not exceeding one eighth of total
profit, if any. Present company
shall not be liable for injuries
inflicted by or sustained as a
consequence thereof, including, but
not limited to - lacerations?
Evisceration? Incineration?

Oh, he'll melt the flesh off your
bones in the blink of an eye.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo seems breathless. He drops the contract to
his side, holding a hand to his chest.
BALIN
You alright, laddie?
BILBO
Yes, but I feel a bit faint.
FILI
Think furnace with wings. Flash of
light, searing pain, then - POOF!
You're nothing more than a pile of
ash!
Bilbo starts PANTING, trying to compose himself as the
others look on. Finally, Bilbo rises, turning to Balin.

Nope.

Bilbo sits at his chair, shivering and clutching a MUG.
BILBO
I'll be alright, just let me sit
quietly for a moment.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf gazes down at him, a look of
disappointment in his eyes.
GANDALF
You've been sitting quietly for far
too long. When did doliles and your
mother's dishes become so important
to you? I remember a young hobbit
who was always running off in
search of elves in the woods. He'd
stay out late, trailing mud and
twigs and fireflies. A young hobbit
who would have liked nothing better
than to find out what was beyond
the borders of the Shire.
(beat)
The world is not in your books and
maps. It's out there.
ANGLE ON: He points to the window in the room. It gleams in
the PEARLY MOONLIGHT.
BILBO
I can't just go running off into
the blue! I am a Baggins of Bag
End!
GANDALF
You are also a Took! Did you know
that your great-great-great-great
uncle, Bullroarer Took was so large
he could ride a real horse?
BILBO
Yes.
GANDALF
Well, he could! In the Battle of
Green Fields, he charged the goblin

ranks. He swung his club so hard,
it knocked the Goblin King's head
clean off, and it sailed a hundred
yards through the air and went down
a rabbit hole. And thus the battle
was won, and the game of golf
invented at the same time.
BILBO
I do believe you made that up.
Gandalf sits himself across from Bilbo.
GANDALF
Well, all good stories deserve
embellishment. You'll have a tale
or two to tell of your own when you
come back.
BILBO
Can you promise that I will come
back?
GANDALF
No. But if you do, you will not be
the same.
BILBO
That's what I thought. I'm sorry,
Gandalf, but I can't sign this.
You've got the wrong hobbit.
Bilbo leaves the contract on the mantle and exits the
sitting room. Gandalf watches him leave, disappointed.

Bilbo enter his bedroom. Balin SIGHS.
BALIN
It appears we have lost our
burglar. Probably for the best. The
odds were always against us. After
all, what are we? Merchants,
miners, tinkers, toy-makers; hardly

Old warriors.
THORIN
I will take each and every one of
these dwarves over an army from the
Iron Hills. For when I called upon
them, they came. Loyalty, honor, a
willing heart; I can ask no more
than that.
BALIN
You don't have to do this. You have
a choice. You've done honorably by
our people. You have built us a new
life for us in the Blue Mountains,
a life of peace and plenty. A life
that is worth more than all the
gold in Erebor.
Thorin withdraws the Dwarvish key from his pocket. He holds
it before Balin for him to see.
THORIN
From my grandfather to my father,
this has come to me. They dreamt of
the day when the dwarves of Erebor
would reclaim their homeland. There
is no choice, Balin. Not for me.
BALIN
Then we are with you, laddie. We'll

With a DEEP SIGH, Balin places a supportive hand on Thorin's

There, Master Worrywort stands at his fence. He sees Bilbo

many other things, Bilbo Baggins,

RADAGAST
Not good! Not good at all!
ANGLE ON: Radagast darts towards his house. Many DEAD PLANTS
and ANIMAL litter the ground. He inspects the plants nearby,
MUSHROOMS, TREES and all.
He steps back from his work, distressed. Radagast gives a
WHISTLE, and a FLOCK OF BIRDS, come sailing down.
Radagast takes off his HAT, revealing a SMALL BIRD NEST on
his head. The birds clamber in and Radagast puts his hat
back on.
CLOSE ON: Something on the ground catches the wizard's eye.

Suddenly, his face falls. Gravely serious, Radagast looks

Witchcraft. But it is; a dark and
powerful magic.
SCURRYING NOISES sound from outside.

GIANT SPIDERS crawling up the house. Panicked, Radagast bars
his door.

air. Suddenly, he seizes up, dead. TEARS WELL in Radagast's
eyes.
The house begins to CREAK. The spiders are climbing onto the
roof.

STONE from its top. He grabs Sebastian from the counter and
leans against a TREE TRUNK.
He begins to WHISPER A SPELL, holding the blue stone to
Sebastian's snout.
As Radagast chants, spiders begin to break the roof above.
PATCHES OF SUNLIGHT dot the floor as RUBBLE of the shattered
roof crumbles downward.
CLOSE ON: Radagast continues to chant, almost in a
TRANCE-LIKE STATE. As the spell grows more and more
powerful, a DARKNESS seems to fall over the house. A BLACK,
INKY SUBSTANCE begins to fill the blue stone, until -

Elrond will help us.

Help? A dragon attacks Erebor, what

did nothing. You ask me to seek out

grandfather and betrayed my father?

You are neither of them. And
besides, it was not Lord Elrond who
abandoned you at Erebor. That blame
lies with King Thranduil of the
Woodland Realm. I did not give you

onto the past.

Who?
BILBO
Gandalf!
DWALIN
He's a wizard, he does as he

BILBO
What's the matter?
KILI
We're supposed to be looking after
the ponies.
FILI
Only, we've encountered a slight

We had sixteen. Now there's
fourteen.

missing.

Bilbo follows behind them, clutching the wooden bowls.
KILI
Daisy and Bungo are missing.
BILBO
Well, that's not good. That is not
good at all. Shouldn't we tell
Thorin?
FILI
No, let's not worry him. As our
official burglar, we thought that
you might like to look into it.
Bilbo looks around, seeing several UPROOTED TREES.
BILBO
Well, something big uprooted these
trees.
FILI
That was our thinking.
BILBO
Something very big and possibly
quite dangerous.

FILI

Hey, there's a light.
Fili beckons the other two forward.
FILI (CONT'D)
Over here. Stay down.
The three rush forward and take cover behind a LOG, spying
on the FLICKERING LIGHT.
HARSH LAUGHTER sounds from near the fire.
BILBO
What is it?
KILI
Trolls.
Fili and Kili run closer to the fire. Bilbo runs after them,
still gripping onto their meals.
THUNDER FOOTSTEPS come from nearby. Quickly, the trio takes
cover behind an aging oak tree.
They are all alarmed to see a massive Mountain Troll,
WILLIAM, walk towards the fire. He holds TWO MORE PONIES at
his side.
BILBO
(whispering)
He's got Myrtle and Minty! I think
they're going to eat them, we have
to do something.
FILI
Yes, you should. Mountain trolls
are slow and stupid, and you're so
small.
BILBO
No!

If you run into trouble, hoot twice

owl.
Bilbo walks forward in reluctance.
BILBO
Twice like a barn owl, once like a
brown owl? Are you sure this is a
good idea?
WIDE ON: He turns around, but Fili and Kili are already out
of site. With a SIGH, Bilbo trudges forward.

EXT. TROLL LAIR - TROLLSHAWS - NIGHT

Two trolls, BERT and TOM sit around a fire. Bert STIRS the
contents of a CAULDRON dangling above the flames. Tom
watches him with a hungry stare.
William enters the lair. He carries the two ponies into a
makeshift pen, locking them inside.
BERT
Mutton yesterday, mutton today and
blimey, if it don't look like
mutton again tomorrow.
WILLIAM
Quite your gripping. These ain't
sheep; these is West Nags!
TOM
I don't like horse, I never have.
Not enough fat on them.
BERT
Well, it's better than that
leathery old farmer. All skin and
bones, he was. I'm still picking
bits of him out of me teeth.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo sneaks around the campsite, hiding behind
trees and bushes.

SNEEZES into the cauldron.

Tom begins to sneeze again, but Bert grabs him by the nose.
Bert forces Tom down.
BERT
Sit down!
ANGLE ON: Bilbo takes advantage of this scuffle, and dashes
towards the pens.
WIDE ON: WHIMPERING, Tom pulls out his HANDKERCHIEF and
blows.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo turns and sees that the troll is wearing a
LONG KNIFE in his belt. The hobbit creeps forward, eyes set
on the blade.
WILLIAM
I'm starving! Are we having horse
tonight or what?
BERT
Shut your cakehole. You'll eat what
I give you!
WILLIAM
How come he's the cook? Everything
tastes the same; everything tastes
like chicken.
TOM
Except the chicken.
WILLIAM
That tastes like fish!

Oh, that is beautifully balanced,
that is!

Bert passes the ladle to Tom, who puts his handkerchief back
over the knife.

reaches for the knife.
WILLIAM
Me guts are grumbling. I've got to
snaffle something. Flesh! I need
flesh!
Bilbo's fingers brush against Tom's knife - so close!
Suddenly, Tom reaches for his handkerchief. Instead, the
troll grabs Bilbo, SPRAYING SNOT all over him. Tom peers
down at the hobbit, taken aback.
TOM
Blimey! Bert, look what's come out
of me hooter! It's got arms and
legs and everything.
The other trolls gather around, staring at Bilbo in
amazement.
WILLIAM
What is it?
TOM
I don't know, but I don't like the
way it wriggles around.
Tom shakes Bilbo to the ground. Slowly, he gets back on his
feet. William stands above Bilbo, pointing a JAGGED ROCK
down at him.
WILLIAM
What are you then, an oversized
squirrel?
BILBO
I'm a burgl- a hobbit!
TOM
A Burgla-Hobbit?

Can we cook him?

We can try!

WIDE ON: Tom tries to grab Bilbo, but he dodges. Bilbo
sprints toward the trees. Toward an escape. However, Bert
corners him.
BERT
He wouldn't make more than a
mouthful, not when he's skinned and
boned!
WILLIAM
Perhaps there's more Burgla-Hobbits
around these parts. Might be enough
for a pie!
All of the trolls try to grab Bilbo, but he outruns them at
every turn.
TOM
It's too quick!
Bilbo runs through Tom's leg as Bert swings his ladle,
aiming for Bilbo. He hits Tom's knee instead, making the
troll YELP out in pain.
ANGLE ON: Finally, William grabs a hold of Bilbo, and
dangles him upside down.
WILLIAM
Are there any more of you little
fellows hiding where you shouldn't?
BILBO
No.
TOM
He's lying.
BILBO
No, I'm not!
TOM
Hang his toes over the fire! Make
him squeal!
Kili emerges from out of the bushes. He hacks Tom's leg,
sending the troll SQUEALING. The other trolls look down at
Kili, startled.

WILLIAM
You what?
KILI
I said, drop him.
GROWLING, William throws Bilbo on top of Kili. The other
dwarves charge out of the treeline, weapons drawn.
Bravely, they fight against the trolls, HACKING and
HAMMERING. As the battle rages on, Bilbo creeps beneath the
trolls' feet, dodging every footfall.
Tom's knife falls from his belt as Fili and Kili hammer down
on his toes. Bilbo sneaks over, grabbing the weapon and
darting over to the pens.
Bilbo cuts the ponies free, sending them running in every
direction. From across the clearing, William sees him. The
troll lumbers over, grabbing Bilbo by his arms and legs.
Seeing Bilbo, the dwarves freeze in place.
FILI
Bilbo!
WILLIAM
Lay down your arms, or we'll rip
his off!
Thorin looks up at Bilbo, conflicted. Finally, he throws his
sword onto the ground, almost in reluctance. The others
follow suit, dropping their swords and axes by their sides.

William throws SEVERAL LOGS onto the fire. Dwalin, Fili, Oin

Bert tends to the spit, spinning it back and forth. Tom
approaches him.
TOM
Don't bother cooking them. Let's

BILBO
Wait! You are making a terrible
mistake!
GLOIN
You can't reason with them, they're
half-wits.
FILI
Half-wits? What does that make us?
BILBO

I meant with the seasoning.
WIDE ON: Although still tied up, Bilbo manages to jump to
his feet.
BERT
What about the seasoning?
BILBO
Well, have you smelt them? You're
going to need something stronger
than sage before you plate this lot
up.
The dwarves YELL IN PROTEST.

The dwarves ROAR in their rage. A grin spreads over Bert's
face.
BERT
Tom, get me filleting knife.
WILLIAM
What a load of rubbish! I've eaten
plenty with their skins on. Scruff
them, I say, boots and all.
ANGLE ON: Suddenly, Bilbo spots Gandalf slipping behind some
trees. The wizard appears on a LARGE ROCK above them. A
powerful rage seems to posses the wizard.
GANDALF
The dawn will take you all!
CLOSE ON: Confused, the trolls turn to Gandalf.
BERT
Who's that?
WILLIAM
No idea.
TOM
Can we eat him too?
ANGLE ON: Gandalf strikes the rock beneath him with his
staff. It breaks in half with a CRACK. Sunlight pours into
the clearing.
The light touches the troll's skin, TURNING THEM INTO STONE

nothing more than STATUES.

THUMPS it's head with his staff, smiling. Thorin approaches
Gandalf.
THORIN
Where did you go to, if I may ask?
GANDALF
To look ahead.
THORIN
What brought you back?
GANDALF
Looking behind. Nasty business;
still, they're all in one piece.
THORIN
No thanks to your burglar.
GANDALF
He had the nous to play for time.
None of the rest of you thought of
that.
Thorin looks repentant. Gandalf turns, examining the trolls.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
They must have come down from the
Ettenmoors.
THORIN
Since when do mountain trolls
venture this far south?

Oh, not for an age. Not since a

enter, the dwarves begin to COUGH AND RETCH at the smell.
KILI
What's that stench?
GANDALF
It's a troll hoard. Be careful what
you touch.
ANGLE ON: The Company finds PILES OF GOLD COINS and OTHER
TREASURES in caskets. Fili approaches the coins scattered
about the ground.
FILI
Seems a shame to leave it lying
around. Anyone could take it.
GLOIN
Agreed. Oin, get a shovel.
Thorin inspects TWO SWORDS covered in cobwebs. He hands one
to Gandalf, unsheathing them. He looks in wonder at the
steel.
THORIN
These were not made by any troll.
GANDALF
Nor were they made by any smith
among men.
Gandalf looks closer at the markings on the blade.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
These were forged in Gondolin by
the High Elves of the First Age.

GLOIN
We're making a long term deposit!
ANGLE ON: Thorin walks past them, his new sword tied to his
belt.
THORIN
Come! Let's get out of this foul
place.
The dwarves file behind Thorin, leaving the cave. Gandalf
makes to follow them, when his foot hits against something
METALLIC.

some leaves. A SMALL SWORD, wrapped neatly in its sheath,
lies in the dirt below.

size.

hesitant.
BILBO
I can't take this.

THORIN
Something's coming!
Gandalf withdraws his sword, running to the dwarves.

explanation of this odd sight.

Webs? What do you mean?

Spiders, Gandalf. Giant ones. Some
kind of spawn of Ungoliant, or I am
not a wizard. I followed their
trail. They came from Dol Guldur.

Dol Guldur? But the old fortress is

Radagast crosses a stone bridge and enters a DARK RUINED

A dark power dwells in there, such
as I have never felt before. It is
the shadow of an ancient horror.
One that can summon the spirits of
the dead.
ANGLE ON: He walks through the seemingly abandoned fortress.
Radagast seems panicked and afraid, clutching his staff with
shaking hands.
Near a HOODED STATUE, Radagast spies a gleam of steel. A
SWORD. He picks it up, looking stunned as he examines the
weapon.
RADAGAST (V.O.)(CONT'D)
I saw him, Gandalf, from out of the
dark. A Necromancer has come.
Radagast turns, seeing the black shadow of THE NECROMANCER
standing in a near tunnel. It WHISPERS a haunting and

Sorry.

Now, a Necromancer? Are you sure?

WRAPPED PACKAGE. Gandalf unties it and looks inside. He
looks up, concerned.

That is not from the world of the
living.
From the distance, WOLVES HOWL. The dwarves perk up in
alarm.
BILBO
Was that a wolf? Are there wolves
out there?

Wolf? No, that is not a wolf.
From behind a nearby crag, a WARG appears. It leaps into the
midst of the Company, savage and ferocious. Thorin buries
his sword into it's neck, killing it.
Another charges from behind. Kili draws an arrow, shooting
down the beast. It attempts to pick itself back up, but
Dwalin brings his hammer down upon it. The warg dies with a
WHIMPER.

plain, weapons drawn. Radagast and the orcs can be seen in
the distance.

determination. The Company continues to weave in and out of
the rocks, led by Thorin and Gandalf.
ANGLE ON: Suddenly, Thorin stops in his tracks. Radagast and
the orcs run past them, too close for comfort. Gandalf looks
to Bilbo and the dwarves.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
Stay together.
He turns around, leading the dwarves back into the barren
fields. The dwarves stop behind another boulder. OUT OF
BREATH and DISORIENTATED, Balin continue to jog forward.
THORIN
Balin, no!
Thorin grabs him by the collar and pulls Balin behind the
rock. Gandalf watches Radagast closely, waiting for the
right moment.
Finally, Gandalf beckons the dwarves to run. Thorin stays
behind with Gandalf, briefly.

Where are you leading us?
Gandalf does not answer. Discontent, Thorin rejoins with the
dwarves.

Radagast, their MAKESHIFT SWORDS drawn high in the air. One
orc abruptly comes to a stop. He SMELLS THE AIR. The orc
observes the rocky ford in suspicion.

behind an outcropping rock, their breath ragged.

The orc is quick to grab for his HORN, but Kili looses his
arrow. Both the orc and his warg are shot off of the boulder
and onto the ground.

Gandalf leads the Company forward. They sprint past rocks,
boulders, bushes and trees. In the distance, the orcs are
coming closer and closer.
The dwarves continue to flee from the scouts, until -
Yazneg emerges from the crest of the hill. Other orcs files
beside their commander, circling around the Company.

warg. He SNARLS VICIOUSLY, giving the Company a deathly
stare. Thorin draws out Orcrist, which GLOWS BLUE.

Yazneg rides closer, glaring all the while. The Company
stares back at him, defiant.
Suddenly, Gandalf pops out from the cavern entrance.
GANDALF
This way, you fools!
THORIN
All of you, go, go!
Bilbo and the dwarves dash towards the cavern entrance. One
by one, they start to SLIDE UNDERGROUND. Seeing this, Yazneg
sends his wargs forward.
As the Company slides into the cavern, Thorin slices the
wargs down. He turns to Kili, still shooting in the field.

BILBO
Gandalf, where are we?
GANDALF
You can feel it?
BILBO
Yes. It feels like - well, like
magic.
GANDALF
That's exactly what it is. A very
powerful magic.
DWALIN
There is light ahead!
Gandalf steps forward with the dwarves. Bilbo looks at him
suspicious.
67
EXT. RIVENDELL OUTSKIRTS - DAY
67
ANGLE ON: The dwarves push through the final stretch of the
pathway. The Company stops at a ridge, looking below them.
WIDE ON: They see a valley gleaming in golden sunlight.
RIVENDELL.
GANDALF
The Valley of Imraldis. In the
Common Tongue, it's known by
another name.
BILBO
Rivendell.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo is amazed. The dwarves, on the other hand,
are extremely displeased.
GANDALF
Here lies the last homely house
east of the sea.
ANGLE ON: Thorin wheels around and glares at Gandalf.
THORIN
This was your plan all along, to
seek refuge with our enemy.

GANDALF
You have no enemies here, Thorin
Oakenshield. The only ill-will to
be found in this valley is that
which you bring yourself.
THORIN
You think the elves will give our
quest their blessing? They will try
to stop us.
GANDALF
Of course they will. But we have
questions that need to be answered.
If we are to be successful, this
will need to be handled with tact
and respect and no small degree of
charm, which is why you will leave
the talking to me.
WIDE ON: Gandalf begins to make his way down the hill and
into the valley. The dwarves reluctantly follow suit.
68
EXT. COURTYARD - RIVENDELL - DAY
68
ANGLE ON: The Company enters the main courtyard of
Rivendell. The entire place seems to be suspended in an
eternal state of tranquility. Bilbo looks around him, awed
by Rivendell's majesty.
A dark-haired elf, LINDIR, walks down a flight of stairs
nearby. He gives Gandalf a courteous smile.
LINDIR
Mithrandir.
GANDALF
Ah, Lindir!
As the two greet one another, the dwarves MURMUR IN
DISTRUST.
LINDIR
(in Elvish; subtitled)
We heard you had crossed into the
Valley.
GANDALF
I must speak with Lord Elrond.

LINDIR
My lord Elrond is not here.
GANDALF
Not here? Where is he?
Suddenly, ELVISH HORNS RING OUT across the courtyard. The
Company turns. ARMED HORSEMAN approach the Company at a
rapid rate. The dwarves raise their weapons, defensive.
Elves ride into courtyard, looking down at the dwarves in
confusion. They circle around the Company, banners caught
high in the breeze. Slowly the elves come to a halt.
CLOSE ON: Their leader, ELROND, separates himself from the
others.
ELROND
Gandalf.
The wizard bows gracefully.
GANDALF
Lord Elrond.
(in Elvish; subtitled)
My friend! Where have you been.
ELROND
(in Elvish; subtitled)
We've been hunting a pack of orcs
that came up from the south. We
slew a number near the hidden pass.
ANGLE ON: Elrond dismounts from his horse, where he and
Gandalf embrace. After they part, Elrond begins to tend to
his armor.
ELROND (CONT'D)
Strange for Orcs to come so close
to our borders. Something, or
someone has drawn them near.
GANDALF
That may have been us.
CLOSE ON: Thorin steps forward. Elrond looks upon him with
recognition.
ELROND
Welcome Thorin, son of Thrain.

THORIN
I do not believe we have met.
ELROND
You have your grandfather's
bearing. I knew Thror when he ruled
under the Mountain.
THORIN
Indeed; he made no mention of you.
Ignoring this insult, Elrond looks to all the dwarves. He
begins to SPEAK IN ELVISH.
ELROND
(In Elvish)
Light the fires, bring forth the
wine. We must feed our guests.
The dwarves grow bellicose and GRIP THEIR WEAPONS UNEASILY.
Gloin jumps forward, raising up his AXE.
GLOIN
What is he saying? Does he offer us
insult?
Gandalf steps forward, stern.
GANDALF
No, master Gloin, he's offering you
food.
The dwarves circle up, discussing with one another in LOW
WHISPERS. Gloin turns back to Elrond, disgruntled.
GLOIN
Well, in that case, lead on.
ANGLE ON: The elf gives a curt nod and strides up the
stairs. The dwarves follow behind him, uneasy.

EXT. ELVEN COURT - RIVENDELL - DAY

ANGLE ON: The dwarves sit around a table, OVERFLOWING WITH
FOOD. However, the dwarves pick at the meal, uninterested.
DWALIN
Where's the meat?

at it in disgust.

and ELF MAIDEN playing the HARP.
GANDALF
Kind of you to invite us. I'm not
really dressed for dinner.
ELROND
Well, you never are.
They both CHUCKLE, and sit themselves at the head of the
table.
CLOSE ON: From the end of the table, Kili and the elf maid
exchange looks. Kili gives her a WINK.
Kili turns, noticing the other dwarves staring at him. He
SHRUGS.
KILI
I can't say I fancy elf maids
myself. To thin. They're all high
cheekbones and creamy skin. Not
enough facial hair for me.
Although, that one there's not bad.
He cocks his head at a passing elf.
DWALIN
That's not an elf maid.
Kili looks as the elf turns, revealing himself to be no elf
maid.
Shocked, Kili looks to the other dwarves. They ROAR WITH
LAUGHTER, banging against the table in their amusement.
KILI
It's funny.
Kili awkwardly picks at his food. Another elf maid passes
the table, playing the FLUTE. Oin stuffs a NAPKIN into his
hearing trumpet, blocking out the music.
ANGLE ON: Elrond holds out Thorin's sword. He carefully
examines it, running his hand up and down the sheath.

ELROND
This is Orcrist, the Goblin
Cleaver. A famous blade, forged by
the High Elves of the West. My kin.
May it serve you well.
He hands Orcrist back to Thorin, who accepts with a nod.
Elrond turns now to Gandalf's sword. He slides the sword
several inches out of its sheath.
ELROND (CONT'D)
And this is Glamdring, the
Foe-hammer, sword of the King of
Gondolin. These swords were made
for the goblin wars of the First
Age.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo looks down at his own small sword underneath
the table. Balin gives him a pitying smile.
BALIN
I wouldn't bother, laddie. Swords
are named for the great deeds they
do in war.
BILBO
What are you saying, my sword
hasn't seen battle?
BALIN
I'm not actually sure it is a
sword; more of a letter opener,
really.
ANGLE ON: Elrond returns Glamdring to Gandalf. Elrond has an
inquiring look about him.
ELROND
How did you come by these?
GANDALF
We found them in a troll hoard on
the Great East Road, shorty before
we were ambushed by orcs.
ELROND
And what were you doing on the
Great East Road?
No one answers. Thorin, looking perturbed, rises.

INT. NARSIL CHAMBER - RIVENDELL - DAY

Gold morning light streams into the chamber. Bilbo
approaches the SHARDS OF NARSIL, held by a great stone
statue.
He gives the sword a brief look, before turning his
attention to the MURAL OF DAGORLAD. SAURON looms above
ISSILDUR, his BLACK MACE raised high in the air.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo looks at the painting in wonder. His
attention is particularly taken by the GOLD RING around
Sauron's finger. THE ONE RING.

Rivendell, and all its many houses.

ANGLE ON: Bilbo stands at the edge of a balcony, looking
down at the rivers and streams below.
Elrond enters the balcony. He strides towards Bilbo and
comes to a stop beside him.
ELROND
Not with your companions?
BILBO
No, I shan't be missed. The truth
is that most of them don't think I
should be on this journey.
ELROND
Indeed? I've heard that hobbits are
very resilient.
BILBO
Really?

ELROND
I've also heard they're fond of the
comforts of home.
BILBO
I've heard that it is unwise to
seek the council of elves, for they
will answer with yes and no.
Elrond looks down at Bilbo, giving him a warm smile. The
hobbit makes a NERVOUS CHUCKLE.
ELROND
You are always welcome to stay
here, if that is your wish.
He turns and leaves the balcony. Bilbo stares after him,
considerate.

INT. ELROND'S CHAMBERS - RIVENDELL - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: Gandalf, Thorin, Bilbo and Balin are gathered in
Elrond's chambers. Thorin stares at Elrond, nothing but PURE
RESENTMENT in his eyes.
THORIN
Our business is no concern of
elves.
GANDALF
For goodness sake, Thorin, show him
the map.
THORIN
It is the legacy of my people; it
is mine to protect, as are its
secrets.
GANDALF
Save me from the stubbornness of
dwarves. Your pride will be your
downfall. You stand here in the
presence of one of the few in
Middle Earth who can read that map.
Show it to Lord Elrond!
Everyone looks to Thorin, waiting. Reluctantly, he draws the
map out of his coat.

Thorin hands Elrond the map.
ELROND
Erebor. What is your interest in
this map?
CLOSE ON: Thorin opens his mouth to speak, but Gandalf
answers first.
GANDALF
It's mainly academic. As you know,
this sort of artifact sometimes
contains hidden text. You still
read ancient dwarvish, do you not?
Elrond walks several paces off, into the moonlight. The map
is bathed in PEARLY WHITE LIGHT.
ELROND
(in Elvish)
Moon runes.
GANDALF
Moon runes? Of course; an easy
thing to miss.
ELROND
Well, in this case, that is true;
moon runes can only be read by the
light of a moon the same shape and
season as the day on which they
were written.
THORIN
Can you read them?
ANGLE ON: Elrond nods. He walks out of the chambers, Gandalf
and the others following behind.

ELROND
These runes were written on a
Midsummer's Eve by the light of a
crescent moon nearly two hundred
years ago. It would seem you were
meant to come to Rivendell. Fate is
with you, Thorin Oakenshield; the
same moon shines upon us tonight.
CLOSE ON: They look up. Clouds pass over the moon, shining
down on the table.
ANGLE ON: Light flows through the map. GLOWING WHITE RUNES
fade into view.
ELROND (CONT'D)
Stand by the gray stone when the
thrush knocks, and the setting sun
with the last light of Durin's Day
will shine upon the keyhole.
BILBO
Durin's Day?
GANDALF
It is the start of the dwarves'
near year, when the last moon of
autumn and the first sun of winter
appear in the sky together.
THORIN
This is ill news. Summer is
passing. Durin's day will soon be
upon us.
BALIN
We still have time.
BILBO
Time? For what?
BALIN
To find the entrance. We have to be
standing at exactly the right spot
at exactly the right time. Then,
and only then, can the door be
opened.
ELROND
So this is your purpose, to enter
the Mountain?

ELROND
You are not the only guardian to
stand watch over Middle Earth.
CLOSE ON: Elrond turns, leaving the others behind. Gandalf
turns slowly, lost in deep thought.
75
INT. DWARVEN CHAMBER - RIVENDELL - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: The dwarves circle around a CAMPFIRE made from
burning ELVISH FURNITURE in their quarters. Fili roasts a
SAUSAGE above the fire.
He looks over at Gloin, sitting on a bench.
FILI
Gloin!
Fili throws the sausage to Gloin. As Gloin catches it, the
bench breaks beneath him. The dwarves LAUGH UPROARIOUSLY.

etched with indecisiveness.
From far below the staircase, Gandalf and Elrond walk across
a bridge. Curious, Bilbo watches them.
GANDALF
Of course I was going to tell you,
I was waiting for this very chance.
And really, I think you can trust
that I know what I am doing.

beast?
GANDALF
What if we succeed? If the dwarves
take back the mountain, our
defenses in the east will be
strengthened.
ELROND
It is a dangerous move, Gandalf.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo notices that Thorin is standing behind him.
He too listens in on the argument.
GANDALF
It is also dangerous to do nothing.
The throne of Erebor is Thorin's
birthright, what is it you fear?
ELROND
Have you forgotten? A strain of
madness runs deep in that family.
His grandfather lost his mind, his
father succumbed to the same
sickness. Can you swear Thorin
Oakenshield will not also fall?
Gandalf, these decisions do not
rest with us alone. It is not up to
you or me to redraw the map of
Middle Earth.
Bilbo looks back at Thorin. His face is unreadable.

EXT. PAVILION - RIVENDELL - NIGHT
77
ANGLE ON: Gandalf and Elrond march up a flight of marble
stairs.
GANDALF
With or without our help, these
dwarves will march on the mountain.
They are determined to reclaim
their homeland. I do not believe
Thorin Oakenshield feels that he's
answerable to anyone. Nor for that
matter am I.

It has been a long time.
Gandalf gives her a gracious bow.

Galadriel smiles at the wizard.

The dragon has long been on your
mind.
GANDALF
It is true, my lady. Smaug owes
allegiance to no one. But if he
should side with the enemy, a
dragon could be used to terrible
effect.
ELROND
What do you mean?
GANDALF
There is something at work beyond
the evil of Smaug. Something far
more powerful. We can remain blind
to it, but it will not be ignoring
us, that I can promise you. A
sickness lies over the Greenwood.
The woodsmen who live there now
call it Mirkwood, and they say...
His voice TRAILS OFF, uncertain.
SARUMAN
Well, don't stop now. Tell us what
the woodsmen say.
GANDALF
They speak of a Necromancer living
in Dol Guldur, a sorcerer who can
summon the dead.
SARUMAN
That's absurd. No such power exists
in this world. This Necromancer is
nothing more than a mortal man. A
conjurer dabbling in black magic.

wizard.
Galadriel stops in her tracks, staring towards Gandalf. She
begins to speak TELEPATHICALLY.
GALADRIEL (V.O.)
You carry something. It came to you
from Radagast. He found it in Dol
Guldur.
GANDALF (V.O.)
Yes.
GALADRIEL (V.O.)
Show me.
ANGLE ON: From out of his robes, Gandalf slowly lifts out
Radagast's PACKAGE. He rests it on the table, letting out a
DULL THUD.
ELROND
What is that?
GALADRIEL
A relic of Mordor.
Elrond reaches towards the package, unwrapping it.
CLOSE ON: The blade from Dol Guldur rests inside. The White
Council looks shocked.
ELROND
A Morgul blade.
GALADRIEL
Made for the Witch-king of Angmar
and buried with him. When Angmar
fell, men of the north took his
body and all that he possessed and
sealed it within the High Fells of
Rhudaur. Deep within the rock they
buried them, in a tomb so dark it
would never come to light.

What proof do we have this weapon
came from Angmar's grave.
GANDALF
I have none.
SARUMAN
Because there is none! Let us
examine what we know. A single Orc
pack has dared to cross the
Bruinen, a dagger from a bygone age
has been found, and a human
sorcerer who calls himself the
Necromancer has taken up residence
in a ruined fortress. It's not so
very much, after all.

GANDALF
Yes.
GALADRIEL
You are right to help Thorin
Oakenshield. But I fear this quest
has set in motion forces we do not
yet understand. The riddle of the
Morgul blade must be answered.
Something moves in the shadows,
unseen, hidden from our sight. It
will not show itself, not yet. But
everyday it grows with strength.
You must be careful.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf turns and paces up and down the pavillion.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
Mithrandir, why the halfling?
Gandalf stares thoughtfully into the sunrise.
GANDALF
I do not know. Saruman believes
that it is only great power that
can hold evil in check. But that is
not what I have found. I've found
that it is the small things,
everyday deeds of ordinary folk
that keeps the darkness at bay.
Simple acts of kindess and love.

DANGEROUS TRAIL on the side of the mountain. A cliff lies on
one side of the path, with a sheer drop on the other.
THORIN

The dwarves carefully make their way across the ridge,
half-drowned in rain. As Bilbo walks, the stone beneath him

mountain.

This is no thunder storm! It's a

mountain. It rips a giant CHUNK OF STONE from the top of the
mountain.

Well, bless me! The legends are

The stone giant throws the rock across the valley. It
crashes into ANOTHER STONE GIANT, rising from the
mountainside. The dwarves watch, caught in the middle.

them begins to CRACK and SPLIT, separating the dwarves.

Kili, Oin, Gloin and Thorin begin to drift away from the

second throws a punch, sending it falling back into its
place on the mountain.

of the Company is seemingly crushed between the stone.

NO!
Thorin runs forward across the ledge. He runs along the
path, finding them alive and well.

84
ANGLE ON: The Company enters a cave. It is dark, still and
silent.
DWALIN
It looks safe enough.
THORIN
Search to the back; caves in
mountains are seldom unoccupied.
Dwalin searches the back of the cave, LANTERN IN HAND. After
a brief investigation, he returns to the others.
DWALIN
There's nothing here.
Gloin drops a BUNDLE OF WOOD on the floor. He grins, rubbing
his hands together.
GLOIN
Right then! Let's get a fire
started.
THORIN
No. No fires, not in this place.
Get some sleep. We start at first
light.
BALIN
We were to wait in the mountains
until Gandalf joined us. That was
the plan.
THORIN
Plans change.
Thorin turns to Fili.
THORIN (CONT'D)
Fili, take the first watch.

WIDE ON: All of the dwarves are asleep, resting on top of
PILES OF LUGGAGE.

ANGLE ON: Packed and ready, Bilbo makes for the cave
entrance. Fili sees him and jumps up.
FILI
Where do you think you're going?
BILBO
Back to Rivendell.
FILI
No, no, you can't turn back now,
you're part of the company. You're
one of us.
BILBO
I'm not though, am I? Thorin said I
should never have come, and he was
right. I'm not a Took, I'm a
Baggins, I don't know what I was
thinking. I should have never ran
out my door.
CLOSE ON: Thorin, awake, stares thoughtfully at the walls,
listening.
FILI
You're homesick; I understand.
BILBO
No, you don't! You don't
understand, none of you do - you're
dwarves! You're used to this life,
to living on the road, never
settling in one place, not
belonging anywhere.
Fili looks slightly offended. Bilbo gives an apologetic
look.
BILBO
I'm sorry, I didn't mean -
Fili shakes his head, looking down at his sleeping
companions.
FILI
No, you're right. We don't belong
anywhere.

I wish you all the luck in the
world. I really do.

Beaming, Fili places his hand on Bilbo's shoulder. Bilbo and
Fili exchange one final look, before Bilbo turns around to
the exit.
FILI
What's that?
Fili points to his belt. Bilbo looks down. He pulls his
sword partway out of its sheath. IT GLOWS BLUE.
ANGLE ON: Suddenly, STRANGE MECHANICAL NOISES comes from the
ground. Thorin raises his head, seeing the sandy ground
beneath him CRACK APART.
THORIN
Wake up! Wake up!
Before anyone can react, the cave floor COLLAPSES DOWNWARDS.

The entire Company goes SAILING DOWN A CHUTE, sliding
through tunnels and passages. The dwarves SCREAM as they are
thrown downwards.

INT. GOBLIN CAGES - MISTY MOUNTAINS - NIGHT
87
ANGLE ON: All of the dwarves fall onto a WOODEN CAGE. As
they struggle to rise, a HORDE OF GOBLINS attack them.
CLOSE ON: The creatures viciously take their weapons,
pushing them forwards. The dwarves attempt to fight back, to
no avail.
ANGLE ON: As they are led away, Bilbo crouches out of sight.
The passing goblins do not even spare him a glance.
CLOSE ON: Oin looks over his shoulder and sees Bilbo. Before
he can do anything, the goblins push him forward.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo scampers to hide behind the RAILINGS. He
watches as the goblins proceed through the darkness. Bilbo
draws out his sword. He follows behind the goblin's path,
unseen.
Suddenly, ONE GOBLIN jumps out in front of him. Armed with a
DAGGER, the goblin rushes forward. Steel meets steel, and
Bilbo barely manages to keep himself alive.
The goblin LEAPS on top of Bilbo, biting into his shoulder.
Bilbo staggers back, falling over the railings. Together,

network of TUNNELS AND WOODEN BRIDGES. Thousands of other
goblins look on, SNARLING.
89
INT. THRONE ROOM - GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT
89
WIDE ON: They are led into the massive throne room and
brought to the feet of THE GREAT GOBLIN.
CLOSE ON: With a WHEEZE and a COUGH, The Great Goblin
lounges on his throne. He is far larger and far uglier than
any other goblin.
ANGLE ON: The goblins pile the dwarves' weapons together.
The Great Goblin leaps from his throne, leaning on a
SKULL-TOPPED MACE for support.
GREAT GOBLIN
Who would be so bold as to come
armed into my kingdom? Spies?
Thieves? Assassins?
His second in command, GRINNAH, steps forward.
GRINNAH
Dwarves, your malevolence.
GREAT GOBLIN
Dwarves?
GRINNAH
We found them on the Front Porch.
GREAT GOBLIN
Well, don't just stand there!
Search them! Every crack, every
crevice.
The goblins rush forward, searching thoroughly. Whatever
they find, the goblins throw on the ground and destroy.
CLOSE ON: One particular goblin grabs Oin's hearing trumpet
and crushes it underfoot.
GREAT GOBLIN
What are you doing in these parts?

GREAT GOBLIN (CONT'D)
Very well, if they will not talk,
we'll make them squawk! Bring out
the mangler! Bring out the bone
breaker! Start with the youngest.
He points to Kili. Thorin quickly steps forward.
THORIN
Wait!
GREAT GOBLIN
Well, well, well, look who it is!
Thorin, son of Thrain, son of
Thror, King Under The Mountain.
The Great Goblin gives a mocking bow.
GREAT GOBLIN (CONT'D)
Oh, but I'm forgetting, you don't
have a mountain. And you're not a
king. Which makes you nobody,
really. But I know someone who
would pay a pretty price for your
head. Just the head, nothing
attached. Perhaps you know of whom
I speak. A vengeful enemy of yours.
CLOSE ON: Thorin looks up in disbelief.
THORIN
Bolg of the North?
The other dwarves look shocked. The Great Goblin chuckles at
their surprise.
ANGLE ON: He turns to the tiny GOBLIN SCRIBE, sitting in a
BASKET.
GREAT GOBLIN
Send word to Bolg of the North.
Tell him, I have found his prize.
The scribe writes down this message on a SLATE. With a
CACKLE, he PULLS A LEVER and sails off into the dark caverns

CLOSE ON: Bilbo lies in a clump of mushrooms. Slowly, he
regains consciousness. The goblin he dueled lies further
off, GASPING FOR BREATH.
ANGLE ON: Out of the darkness, a strange figure approaches.
Walking on all fours, it crawls to the goblin. It is GOLLUM.
GOLLUM
Yes, yes, yes!
(starts to cough)
Gollum. Gollum.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo hides behind the mushrooms. He watches
Gollum circle around the goblin.
ANGLE ON: Gollum drags the goblin by his feet. Suddenly, it
springs to life, grabbing Gollum. In response, Gollum grabs
a near ROCK, and pounds it against the goblin's head.
CLOSE ON: As Gollum beats down on the goblin, a GOLDEN RING
falls out of his loincloth. It lands on the ground with a
SOFT THUD.
ANGLE ON: The goblin falls backwards, knocked out. Gollum
continues to pull the goblin away.
GOLLUM (CONT'D)
Nasty goblinses. Better than old
bones, precious. Better than
nothing!
Gollum rounds a corner, out of sight. Once he is gone, Bilbo
jumps out of the mushroom patch and retrieves his sword. It
still GLOWS BLUE.
CLOSE ON: By the light of the sword, Bilbo sees the Ring
below him. Intrigued, he picks it up and examines it.
Gollum begins to MOAN in the distance. Without a second
thought, Bilbo drops the Ring in his pocket. He follows the
sound of Gollum's voice.
SMEAGOL
Too many boneses, precious. Not
enough flesh!
GOLLUM
Shut up! Get its skin off. Start
with its head.

WIDE ON: Bilbo creeps around the corner. He sees Gollum, or
in this case SMEAGOL, silhouetted on top of an OUTCROPPING
ROCK in the middle of a SMALL LAKE. Smeagol sings joyfully
as he beats the goblin.
SMEAGOL
(singing)
The cold hard lands, they bites our
hands, they gnaws our feet. The
rocks and stones, they're like old
bones, all bare of meat. Cold as
death, they have no breath, its
good to eat.
With a HOWL, the goblin wakes again, but Gollum is too quick
for him. He smashes in the goblin's head with another stone.
Suddenly, Gollum looks up and sees the glow of Bilbo's
sword.
ANGLE ON: Panicked, Bilbo dives behind a boulder. The light
of his sword slowly FLICKERS AWAY. The goblin is dead. Bilbo
peers over at Gollum's rock with caution.
He is gone.
CLOSE ON: Gollum is mounted on a SMALL, WOODEN BOAT. Using
his hands as paddles, he swims across the lake.
Bilbo still hides behind the rock. His breath is QUICK AND
PAINED. He is afraid.
From behind him, he hears a SCUFFLING NOISE. Bilbo turns to
look up. Gollum is climbing the rock above. He jumps down,
and gives Bilbo a toothy grin.
GOLLUM
Bless us and splash us, precious!
That's a meaty mouthful!
ANGLE ON: Gollum crawls towards Bilbo. The hobbit points the
tip of his sword at Gollum's throat. He retreats in fear.
GOLLUM (CONT'D)
Gollum. Gollum.
BILBO
Back! Stay back! I'm warning you,
don't come any closer.
Bilbo rises, pointing the blade down at Gollum.

GOLLUM (CONT'D)
What is it, precious? What is it?
BILBO
My name is Bilbo Baggins.
GOLLUM
Bagginses? What is a Bagginses,
precious?
BILBO
I'm a hobbit, from the Shire.
GOLLUM
Oh! We like goblinses, batses and
fishes, but we haven't tried
hobbitses before. Is it soft? Is it
juicy?
Gollum steps closer to Bilbo, mouth watering. Bilbo holds
out his sword, waving it wildly about.
BILBO
Now, now, keep your distance! I'll
use this if I have to!
WIDE ON: Gollum SNARLS LOUDLY. It echos across the cave.
BILBO (CONT'D)
I don't want any trouble, do you
understand? Just show me the way to
get out of here, and I'll be on my
way!
GOLLUM
Why? Is it lost?

Yes, yes, and I want to be unlost
as soon as possible.

Wasn't talking to you.

SMEAGOL
Well, yes, we was, precious, we
was.
BILBO
Look, I don't know what your game
is, but I -
Suddenly, Smeagol leaps onto the stone, excited.
SMEAGOL
Games? We love games, doesn't we,
precious?
(to Bilbo)
Does it like games? Does it? Does
it? Does it like to play?
BILBO
Maybe?
Smeagol holds up his hand and begins to recite a riddle.
SMEAGOL
What has roots as nobody sees, is
taller than trees. Up, up, up it
goes, and yet never grows.
Bilbo takes some time to think it over.
BILBO
The mountain.

Gollum!
ANGLE ON: Gollum begins to lunge at Bilbo. Bilbo holds up a
hand.
BILBO
No! No! I want to play, I do. I can
see that you are very good at this.
So, why don't we have a game of
riddles? Yes? Just you and me.
Smeagol scuttles forward, excited.
SMEAGOL
Just us?
BILBO
Yes. Yes. And if I win, you show me
the way out.
CLOSE ON: With a GROWL, Gollum turns away. He crouches
behind the stone, speaking to his Smeagol half.
GOLLUM
And if it loses? What then?
SMEAGOL
If it loses, precious, then we eats
it.
Smeagol pops out from behind the stone.
SMEAGOL (CONT'D)
If Baggins loses, we eats it whole.
Bilbo pauses, digesting this information. Reluctantly, he
begins to sheath his sword.

Fair enough.

Thirty white horses on a red hill.
First they champ, then they stamp,
then they stand still.
Smeagol thinks long and hard. Finally, he replies.
SMEAGOL
Teeth?
Bilbo looks unhappy; Smeagol is correct.
SMEAGOL (CONT'D)
(laughing)
Teeth! Yes, my precious! But we, we
only have nine.
Smeagol opens his mouth wide, displaying his nine teeth.
Bilbo is disgusted.
SMEAGOL (CONT'D)
Our turn. Voiceless it cries,
wingless flutter, toothless bites,
mouthless mutters.
ANGLE ON: Smegol creeps forward, unsettling Bilbo. He tries
is best to keep a rock between the two of them.
BILBO
Just a minute.
Bilbo walks off to the side of the lake. Smeagol suddenly
becomes excited.
SMEAGOL
Oh, we knows! We knows!

yet golden treasure inside is hid.
Smeagol turns around, MUTTERING to himself.
SMEAGOL
Box... and a lid, then a key...
BILBO
Well?
SMEAGOL
It's nasty.
Smeagol paces up and down the slab of rock. Bilbo looms over
him, triumphant.
BILBO
Give up?
SMEAGOL
Give us a chance, precious, give us
a chance!
Frustrated, Smeagol pounds down at the floor. He PUCKERS HIS
FACE, deep in furious thought. Suddely, he opens his eyes,
smiling widely.
SMEAGOL
Eggses!
Bilbo frowns. Smeagol has gotten right yet another riddle.
SMEAGOL (CONT'D)
Eggses! Wet, crunchy, little
eggses. Grandmother tought us to
suck them, yes!

riddle.
GOLLUM
Answer us!
BILBO
Give me a moment, please! I gave
you a good long while.
Bilbo walks in circles around the slab, shaking his head.
BILBO
I don't know this one.
GOLLUM
Is it tasty? Is it scrumptious? Is
it crunchable?
Out of nowhere, Gollum appears behind Bilbo and grabs his
neck. Bilbo jumps away, aiming his sword straight at Gollum.
BILBO
Let me think. Let me think.
Slowly, Bilbo backs away. Smeagol watches with a grin.
SMEAGOL
It's stuck. Bagginses is stuck.
Bilbo paces back and forth, frustrated.

Bilbo's grasp around the Ring tightens. Slowly, Gollum turns

He stole it. He stole it! HE STOLE

Gandalf slices through the oncoming goblins like butter. The

Gollum turns back around. Although he cannot see him, Gollum
stares straight at Bilbo. Bilbo grips his sword, hesitating.
SALTY TEARS begin to well in Gollum's eyes. For a second, he
seems almost human.
Out of pity, Bilbo lowers his sword. He takes a DEEP BREATH,
and steps back. Gollum begins to SNARL, hearing him. Bilbo
runs forward and leaps over Gollum, knocking him down in the
process.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo flees out of the exit, into the daylight.
CLOSE ON: Enraged, Gollum jumps to his feet. He scrabbles
around himself, grabbing for Bilbo.
GOLLUM
Baggins! Thief! Curse it and crush
it, we hates it forever!

WIDE ON: Far ahead of Bilbo, Gandalf stops to count the
dwarves as they catch up.
GANDALF
Three, four, five, Gloin, that's
six. And Dwalin, that makes seven.
Gandalf looks around him for Bilbo.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
Where's Bilbo? Where is our hobbit?
None of the dwarves answer.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo has caught up with the others. He stands
behind a tree, LISTENING.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
Where is our hobbit?
DWALIN
Curse the halfling! Now he's lost!

Well, where did you last see him?
OIN
I think I saw him slip away when
they fist cornered us.
Gandalf becomes greatly discontent. Almost panicked.
GANDALF
What happened exactly? Tell me!
THORIN
I'll tell you what happened. Master
Baggins saw his chance and he took
it. He's thought of nothing but his
soft bed and his warm hearth since
first he stepped out of his door.
We will not be seeing our hobbit
again. He is long gone.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo leans against the tree, seemingly CRUSHED.
The dwarves look at one another, indifferent.
ANGLE ON: Bilbo, NOW VISIBLE, steps out from behind the
tree.
BILBO
No, he isn't.
The dwarves look surprised. Gandalf's face lights up in
relief.
GANDALF
Bilbo Baggins! I've never been so
glad to see anyone in my life!
Bilbo steps closer. The dwarves circle around him, stunned.
KILI
Bilbo! We'd given you up!

Bilbo gives a NERVOUS LAUGH as he slips the Ring into his
pocket. Gandalf notices, but says nothing.
GANDALF
Well, what does it matter? He's
back.
THORIN
It matters. I want to know; why did
you come back?
BILBO
Look, I know you doubt me. I know
you always have. And you're right.
I often think of Bag End. I miss my
books, and my armchair, and my
garden. See, that's where I belong.
That's home. And you don't have
one, a home. It was taken from you.
But I will help you take it back if
I can.
CLOSE ON: The dwarves are taken aback. Slowly, it dawns on
them: Bilbo cares. Gandalf, impressed, shares a warm smile
with the hobbit.

EXT. CLIFFSIDE - WILDERLAND - DAY

ANGLE ON: Looming above the dwarves, a TROOP OF ORCS ride to
the edge of the cliff. At the head of the pack rides BOLG OF
THE NORTH.
Half blind, muscular and tall, Bolg looks to be a force to
be reckoned with. He turns to the Orcs behind him, pointing
forward.
BOLG
(in Black Speech;

Run them down! Tear them to pieces!
At his call, his troop races down the cliffside, mounted on
JET BLACK WARGS.

WIDE ON: Bolg and his orcs speed through the THICK TREES,
weapons drawn. Suddenly, an EAR SPLITTING ROAR rings through
the forest.
ANGLE ON: The orc pack skids to a halt, looking for the
noise.
Further along, the dwarves come to a stop. The look in
dismay at one another.

This way, quickly!
Gandalf resumes his run. With haste, Bilbo and the dwarves
follow after him.

past them. They reach the door, throwing themselves against
it in desperation.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf looks as a MASSIVE BEAR breaks out from
the edge of the forest and barrels towards them.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
Open the door!
Thorin pushes through the dwarves. He manages to raise the
EXTERIOR BOLT, opening the doors. As the bear crashes
through the gate, the entire company floods into the home.

The dwarves attempt to slam the door shut. However, the bear
pushes his head inside, ROARING and SNARLING.
Panicked, the dwarves push against the door, SCREAMING.
Bilbo withdraws his sword and points it up at the bear.
Gandalf only watches, calm.
With a final heave, the dwarves manage to close the door and
drop the bolt across it. Catching their breath, everyone
looks to Gandalf.
BILBO
What is that?
GANDALF
That is our host. His name is Beorn
and he's a skinchanger. Sometimes
he's a huge, black bear, sometimes
he's a great, strong man. The bear
is unpredictable, but the man can
be reasoned with. However, he is
not overfond of dwarves.
The dwarves look at one another, distressed. Bilbo peaks
through a crack in the door.
BILBO
He's leaving.
Fili steps forward. He places a hand on Bilbo's shoulder.
FILI
Get away from there. It's not

INT. BEORN'S HOUSE - WILDERLAND - NIGHT
104
Most of the dwarves sleep throughout the house, peaceful and
at ease. Thorin sits beside a window, looking out at the
VAST FIELDS. Gandalf sits among the resting dwarves, smoking
his pipe.
Bilbo and Balin are seated at the kitchen table, staring
into the CRACKLING FLAMES.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo turns to Balin, confused.
BILBO
Balin, who was that out there? The
orc?
BALIN
Bolg of the North. An ancient enemy
of Durin's Folk.
BILBO
Ancient enemy. That's why he's
chasing us?
BALIN
Aye. After the dragon took the
Lonely Mountain, Thorin's
grandfather, King Thror, tried to
reclaim the ancient dwarf kingdom
of Moria.
105
EXT. MORIA GATES - MISTY MOUNTAINS - DAY (FLASHBACK)
WIDE ON: THOUSANDS OF DWARVES fight THOUSANDS OF ORCS before
the great gates of Moria. YOUNGER VERSIONS of Thorin, Balin

Bodies drop left and right. Fatal blows are dealt to both
armies. With one fall of their swords, Thorin, Thrain and
Thror fight off the orcs with great skill.
Amongst the carnage, a pale-white orc looms over the armies,
SCARS strewn across his bare chest. AZOG THE DEFILER.
He gives a MIGHTY ROAR, wiping out dwarves with his MASSIVE
MACE.
BALIN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Moria had been taken by legions of
orcs led by the most vile of all
their race. Bolg's father, Azog the
Defiler. The giant Gunabad Orc had
sworn to wipe out the line of
Durin.
CLOSE ON: Azog spots Thror in the battlefield and lumbers
forward. The dwarven king looks small and weak compared to
his colossal enemy.

Thorin listens from the window as he stares into the wild.

feet.

Their bodies fall from the cliffs around Moria. A MORBID

Dwarves begin to flee the battleground. The orcs have the
upper hand.

Orc.

is armed with SWORD AND SHIELD, a FINE PLATE OF ARMOR
protecting him.
BALIN (V.O.)
He stood alone against this
terrible foe.
Azog swings his mace, knocking away Thorin's shield. Thorin
hacks at Azog, but with another swing of the mace, he finds
his sword flying out of his hands as well.
The force of the blow causes Thorin to fall backwards. Azog
makes his way towards him, GOING IN FOR THE KILL. Just then,
Thorin grabs a near OAKEN BRANCH, dodging at Azog's swing.

His armor rent, he wielded nothing
but an oaken branch as a shield.
CLOSE ON: A powerful swing sends Thorin to the ground once
again. Azog looms over Thorin, ready to kill. A fallen sword
lies beside Thorin. Quickly, he picks up the weapon and
rises.
ANGLE ON: Thorin charges forward, his sword meeting with
Azog's mace. Determined, Thorin checks a blow against Azog.
The orc stumbles backwards. He swings his sword, slicing off
Azog's head. Thorin has cut the head off the snake.
BALIN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Azog the Defiler learned that day
that the Line of Durin could not be
so easily broken. From that day
forth, Bolg had sworn to avenge his
father.
WIDE ON: Thorin raises Azog's head above his own, SHOUTING
WAR CRIES. Bolg looks on from the battleground, enraged.
Thorin rallies his men, charging against their enemies with
savage force. The remaining orcs are wiped out.

Thorin turns away from the window, visibly moved. All of the
dwarves have woken and are standing in awe before Thorin. A
warm smile splits across Balin's face.
Bilbo still seems befuddled.
BILBO
But Bolg of the North, he's still
out there.
Thorin steps closer to Bilbo, swollen in his pride.

Aye. But we'll be waiting for him.
Gandalf and Thorin exchange glances. A hint of doubt lies

the kitchen. Gandalf and the dwarves are all gathered there,
with Beorn looming over them.

OF MILK for Fili, locking eyes with Thorin.
BEORN
So you are the one they call
Oakenshield? Tell me, why is Bolg
of the North hunting you?
THORIN
You know of Bolg? How?
BEORN
My people were the first to live in
the mountains, before the orcs came
down from the north. Bolg and his
father Azog killed most of my
family, but some he enslaved. Not
for work, you understand, but for
sport. Caging skin-changers and
torturing them seemed to amuse him.

Fell things creep beneath those

except in great need.
GANDALF
We will take the Elven Road. That
path is still safe.
BEORN
Safe? The Wood-Elves of Mirkwood

Saruman the White says it is not
possible. The enemy is destroyed
and will never return.

Gandalf STUTTERS, trying to think of what to say. Suddenly,
another LOUD CAW echoes across the grasslands.

BILBO
This forest feels sick, as if a
disease lies upon it. Is there no
way around?

Not if we go two hundred miles
north, or twice that distance
south.
Gandalf goes deeper into the forest and comes across an IVY

the Ring in his pocket.

Do not enter that mountain without
me. This is not the Greenwood of
old. The very air of the forest is
heavy with illusion. It will seek
to enter your mind and lead you
astray.
Confused, Bilbo turns to the dwarves surrounding.
BILBO
Lead us astray? What does that
mean?
A LIGHT RAIN begins to come down from the skies.
GANDALF
You must stay on the path; do not
leave it. If you do, you will never
find it again.

MURKY STREAM. Bilbo is the first to reach the other side.
CLOSE ON: Exhausted, Bilbo takes a seat. Thorin, holding a
BOW AND ARROW, jumps down from the bridge. He lands beside a
startled Bilbo.
Suddenly, there is a RUSTLING NOISE from the trees.
Bilbo rises, as he sees a WHITE STAG TROT into a clearing.
It SHIMMERS against the gloomy forest backdrop, like a
beacon of hope.
From beside him, Thorin slowly DRAWS HIS BOW.
BILBO
What are you doing?
Thorin and the stag locks eyes. For a moment, he seems to
hesitate.

the stag running off into the woods.
BILBO (CONT'D)
You shouldn't have done that. It's
bad luck.
CLOSE ON: Thorin shakes his head, oddly enraged.
THORIN
I don't believe in luck. We make
our own luck.
122
EXT. MIRKWOOD - NIGHT
122
WIDE ON: Darkness settles in between the Mirkwood trees. The
dwarves wander the forest, aimless and exhausted.
ANGLE ON: Gloin stamps the end of his axe against the
ground. There is no sound of metal on stone.
KILI
We need to take a rest.
Thorin nods in agreement, disorientated. The dwarves stop to
catch their breath. Bilbo sits beside a CLUMP OF SPIDERWEBS.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo perks up in alarm. STRANGE WHISPERS echo
around the forest.
BILBO
What is that? Those voices, can you
hear them?
THORIN
I hear nothing. No wind, no birds.
He stares up at the ROOF OF LEAVES, glowing blue in the
moonlight.
THORIN (CONT'D)
What hour is it?
DWALIN
I do not know. I don't even know
what day it is.
THORIN
This is taking too long. Too long!
Is there no end to this accursed
forest?

GLOIN
None that I can see. Only trees and

Gloin looks around him, strangely panicked.
ANGLE ON: Thorin slowly walks forward, seeing something.
THORIN
There! This way!
OIN
But Gandalf said -
THORIN
Do as I say; follow me!
The dwarves trudge forward.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo still sits beside the webs, hearing the
voices. He absentmindedly PLUCKS the webs, which VIBRATES.
The vibrations carry onto other linked webs, leading off
into the forest. Bilbo looks up, troubled.
ANGLE ON: He rises, pointing to the Elven Path behind him.
BILBO
Wait! Stop! We can't leave the
path! We must stay on the path!
No one answers.
123
EXT. MIRKWOOD - DAY
123
CLOSE ON: Bilbo and the dwarves stumble forward. Bilbo looks
down, and sees his feet WALK BACKWARDS. He looks back up,
bewildered.
Bilbo turns to Gloin walking behind him. He sees HIMSELF
staring back at him. Even more confused, Bilbo turns back
around him. He continues down the forest, his vision TILTING
and SHIFTING.
ANGLE ON: Gloin leans down and picks up a TOBACCO POUCH.
GLOIN
Look. A tobacco pouch. There's
dwarves in these woods.
Fili takes the pouch from Gloin. He looks surprised.

Dwarves from the Blue Mountains, no

as mine.
BILBO
Because it is yours. You
understand? We're going around in
circles. We are lost!
DWALIN
We're not lost. We keep heading
east.
OIN
But which way is east? We've lost
the sun!
The dwarves begin to BICKER INDISTINCTLY.
HIGH ANGLE: Bilbo peers up at the leaves above. A bit of
sunlight creeps through the tree canopy far above him.
BILBO
The sun. We have to find the sun.
Up there! We need to -
ANGLE ON: He turns to the dwarves. They begin to PUSH and
SHOVE one another. Thorin stands away from the others,
listening. He hears LOW WHISPERING.
THORIN
What was that?
(turns to the others)
Quiet, all of you! We're being
watched.
Bilbo begins to climb the CROOKED TREES. Around him, masses
of spiderwebs are interwoven through the forest.
124
EXT. TREETOPS - MIRKWOOD - DAY
124
WIDE ON: Bilbo pops out of the MULTICOLORED TREETOPS of
Mirkwood. His head clears, as if a spell has been broken.
Bilbo LAUGHS, relieved, as BLUE BUTTERFLIES flutter around
him.
In the distance, he sees RIVERS and LAKES.
BILBO
I can see a lake! And a river.

BILBO (CONT'D)
And the Lonely Mountain! We're
almost there! Can you hear me? I
know which way to go!
The dwarves do not reply.
BILBO (CONT'D)
Hello?
From below, he can hear TREES CRACKING. The treetops RUSTLE,
as if something is approaching. Worried, Bilbo creeps below
the treeline.
125
EXT. MIRKWOOD - DAY
125
ANGLE ON: Bilbo peers below him. He steps forward, and his
feet catch on a SPIDERWEB. Bilbo falls downward, bouncing
off SEVERAL BRANCHES, SCREAMING all the while.
He lands on another branch, catching his breath. He watches
in horror as the webs part, revealing a GINORMOUS SPIDER. It
opens its fangs and HISSES, sending Bilbo to fall backwards
onto a MASSIVE SPIDERWEB.
The spider CRAWLS forward, quickly wrapping Bilbo up inside
the web.
126
EXT. MIRKWOOD - DAY - LATER
126
CLOSE ON: Wrapped up in webs, the dwarves dangle down from
tree branches. Several LARGE SPIDERS creep around them,
whispering to each other.
ANGLE ON: One particular spider tows a web-encased Bilbo
towards the dwarves. As the spider feels him up, Bilbo
slowly begins to awake. He looks up through the webs,
startled.
Bilbo manages to swing his sword, cutting through both the
web and the spider. The creature HOWLS IN PAIN, staggering
backwards. It goes flying off of the branch, dead.
Bilbo rips off the web cocoon and rises. He sees the dwarves
and the spiders surrounding them. Carefully, Bilbo creeps
behind a tree trunk and slips on his Ring.
CLOSE ON: He is transported into the blurry Ring World once
again. The spiders' whispering ECHOES around him.

SPIDER #3
Their hide is tough! There's good
juice inside!
SPIDER #1
Stick it again! Stick it again!
Finish it off!
ANGLE ON: The spiders approach Gloin, wrapped in his own
web-cacoon. He springs to life, kicking against the GLOSSY
WEBS. He can't do much.
SPIDER #4
Ah! The meat's alive and kicking!
SPIDER #1
Kill them now! Kill them now!
SPIDER #2
Feast! Feast! Feast!
All of the spiders take up the chant, circling around the
dwarf. Bilbo steps forward, and grabs a PIECE OF WOOD from
the trees.
He throws it into the woods below. The spiders perk up,
distracted. They all rush together towards the source of the
noise.
SPIDER #3
What is it? What is it? Kill it!
Feast!
One spider stays behind, preparing to eat Gloin. The dwarf
KICKS and WAILS against the spider.
SPIDER #2
Fat and juicy! Just a little taste!
Invisible, Bilbo sneaks up and strikes his sword against the
spider's rear. The spider spins around and HISSES, but Bilbo
still hacks away at the creature.

BILBO
Here.
Bilbo drives his sword into the spider's head. It WHIMPERS.
SPIDER #2
It stings! Stings! Stings!
ANGLE ON: Bilbo pulls out his sword, sending the spider
crashing to the ground. Bilbo examines his sword.
BILBO
Sting. That's a good name.
He looks to where the other dwarves are wrapped up.
BILBO (CONT'D)
Sting.
Bilbo walks forward, using Sting to cut down the dwarves
from their branches.
CLOSE ON: They land on the forest floor, and proceed to rip
off their wrappings, CURSING and YELLING. Fili emerges from
his cacoon, PANICKED.
FILI
Where's Bilbo?
Bilbo peers down at the dwarves, waving.
BILBO
I'm up here!
Suddenly, a spider jumps at Bilbo from underneath the
branch.
ANGLE ON: The hobbit falls backwards, and the spider pins
him to the ground. Bilbo manage to raise his sword, and
stabs the spider through the belly.
The spider begins to fall off the branch. Entangled in its
legs, Bilbo falls with it, SCREAMING all the while. As they
fall, the Ring slips out of Bilbo's grasp.
He lands on the LEAF COVERED GROUND and begins to search for
the Ring, desperate.

The dwarves begin to rush out of their web cacoons,
brandishing weapons. DOZENS OF SPIDERS approach the Company.
They HISS and SNARL as they creep forward.
The dwarves begin to hack away at the army of spiders. Left
and right, the dead fall to the ground. Oin is knocked to
the ground by one spider. It looms over him, ready to feast.
DWALIN
Grab a leg!
Dwalin leads the others towards the spider. Each dwarf grabs
one or two legs and PULLS. The legs PLOP off of the spider's
body. Dismembered, the spider falls on top of Oin, dead.
CLOSE ON: Further off, Bilbo continues to search for the
Ring. He seems greatly distressed. Panicked.
BILBO
Where is it? Where is it? Where is
it?
He freezes. Slowly, Bilbo looks over his shoulder.
WIDE ON: The Ring lies on the nearby ground, unstained and
untarnished by the MUD and DIRT.
ANGLE ON: Relieved, Bilbo steps forward.
Suddenly, a SMALL, PALE SPIDER emerges from the ground. The
spider pushes the Ring aside as it crawls forward.
Bilbo looks at the spider, infuriated. He raises Sting high
above his head, and runs forward with a YELL.
He hacks and slashes away at the spider. The spider falls to
the ground, dead. Still, Bilbo slices away, berserk. He cuts
away legs, feelers, and more. Finally, he jumps and sends
the sword down into the spider's head.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo catches his breath, staring down at the
Ring. He picks it up, holding the Ring beside his face.
BILBO (CONT'D)
Mine.
Satisfied, Bilbo sits next to the dead spider. He examines
the Ring, turning it forwards and backwards in his hands.
Finally, what he has just done dawns on Bilbo. Disgusted,
Bilbo looks at the spiderwebs and gore covering him.

SHOUTING sounds from the distance.
ANGLE ON: The dwarves are killing off the last of the
spiders. Their swords rise and fall, slicing away legs and
digging into brains. Thorin pauses amongst the chaos,
looking up at the treetops.
Above them, a BLONDE ELF runs through the branches. He grabs
onto SPIDER SILK, sliding down to the ground. The elf lands
on the ground, sliding towards the dwarves. As he moves, he
kills the spiders around him.
Finally, the elf comes to a halt. He points an arrow at
Thorin, revealing him to be -
LEGOLAS
Do not think I won't kill you
dwarf. It would be my pleasure.
LEGOLAS GREENLEAF.
WIDE ON: DOZENS OF WOODLAND ELVES encircle the Company, bows
drawn. Legolas turns to the others.
LEGOLAS (CONT'D)
Search them!
ANGLE ON: The elves begin to riffle through the dwarves'
coats and pockets. One elf, TAURIEL, stands over Fili,
confiscating his MANY KNIVES.
CLOSE ON: Legolas pulls an AMULET from Gloin's beard.
GLOIN
Give it back! That's private!
Legolas sees a picture of a dwarf inside.
LEGOLAS
Who is this? Your brother?
GLOIN
That is my wife.
Legolas looks at the other picture. A picture of a dwarf
child.
LEGOLAS
And what is this horrid creature? A

LEGOLAS

Are the spiders dead?
TAURIEL
(in Elvish; subtitled)
Yes, but more will come. They're
growing bolder.
Legolas looks only vaguely troubled. An elf steps forward,
handing Legolas Thorin's sword, Orcrist.
LEGOLAS
(in Elvish; subtitled)
This is an ancient Elvish blade.
Forged by my kin.
(in the Common Tongue)
Where did you get this?
ANGLE ON: He points the sword towards Thorin.
THORIN
It was given to me.
LEGOLAS
Not just a thief, but a liar as
well.
Legolas shouts a command to the other elves. They begin to
lead the dwarves out of the forest.
CLOSE ON: As they walk, Fili looks to Thorin, troubled.

Where's Bilbo?
Thorin scans the forest. There is no sign of Bilbo.

dwarves SHOUT AND PROTEST through the metal bars.
DWALIN
This is not the end of it! Do you
hear me?
GLOIN
Let us out of here!
An elf inspects Fili once again, and finds another large
knife in his coat. Fili SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION as he is
dragged into his cell.
CLOSE ON: Fili watches from his cell. Tauriel begins to
close the door.

trousers.

Leave it! There's no way out! This

halls of the Woodland Realm. No one
leaves here but by the king's
consent.
Disappointed, the dwarves sit and sulk in their cells.

WIDE ON: Thorin stands before King Thranduil. The Elvenking
circle around the dwarf, glaring down at him.
THRANDUIL
Some may imagine that a noble quest
is at hand. A quest to reclaim a
homeland and slay a dragon. I
myself suspect a more prosaic
motive: attempted burglary, or
something of that ilk.
CLOSE ON: Thranduil looks closely at Thorin.
THRANDUIL (CONT'D)
You have found a way in. You seek
that which would bestow upon you
the right to rule: The King's
Jewel. The Arkenstone. It is
precious to you and your people
beyond measure. I understand that.
There are gems in the mountain that
I too desire. White gems of pure
starlight. I offer you my help.
THORIN
I am listening.

I will let you go if you but return
what is mine.

us!
Enraged, Thorin spins around and points to Thranduil.
THORIN (CONT'D)
You lack all honor! I have seen how
you treat your friends! We came to
you once, starving, homeless,
seeking your help, but you turned
your back. You turned away from the
suffering of my people and the
inferno that destroyed us!
(in Dwarvish)
Die a death of flames!
CLOSE ON: Infuriated, Thranduil leans forward. He and Thorin
are nose to nose.
THRANDUIL
Do not speak to me of dragon fire.
I know its wrath and ruin.
Suddenly, Thranduil's face contorts, revealing hidden BURNS
and SCARS. Thorin looks surprised.
THRANDUIL (CONT'D)
I have faced the great serpents of
the north.
ANGLE ON: He draws away, his face returning to normal.
THRANDUIL (CONT'D)
I warned your grandfather of what
his greed would summon, but he
would not listen. You are just like
him.
Thranduil motions to the guards. They begin to drag Thorin

linger in the shadows?
Bilbo freezes.

We cleared the forest as ordered,
my lord, but more spiders keep
coming up from the south. They are
spawning in the ruins of Dol
Guldur, if we could kill them at
their source.
THRANDUIL
That fortress lies beyond our
borders. Keep our lands clear of
those foul creatures, that is your
task.
TAURIEL
But will they not spread to other
lands?
THRANDUIL
Other lands are not my concern. The
fortunes of the world may rise and
fall, yet here in this kingdom, we
will endure.
Bilbo scuffles out of the chamber. Thranduil looks his way,
suspicious. Tauriel bows, and leaves Thranduil to himself.

Bilbo sneaks into the wine cellar. Elves are tying EMPTY
BARRELS together. ELROS approaches them, carrying a RING OF
DUNGEON KEYS in his hands.
ELROS
These empty barrels should have
been sent back to Esgaroth hours
ago. The bargeman will be waiting
for them.
A DRUNK ELF stumbles forward.

Gandalf climbs a narrow, stone STAIRCASE built into the side
of the tall, bare mountain. Just as he reaches a DOORWAY
carved into the rock, the step beneath him GIVES WAY.
Quickly, Gandalf catches himself and climbs onto the DOORWAY
entrance.

BARS bent away from the doorway. Long ago, they had covered
the entrance.
Cautious, Gandalf steps inside.

ANGLE ON: Suddenly, he is grabbed by some INVISIBLE FORCE
and pulled through a SHORT TUNNEL in the mountain.
He comes to a halt at the end of the tunnel, which leads
into a VAST and CAVERNOUS HOLLOW. Catching his breath,
Gandalf peers over the edge of the ledge. A DARK, EMPTY PIT
lies below, leading into some unknown darkness.
CLOSE ON: Gandalf cradles the top of his staff in his hand
and BLOWS. The staff begins to GLOW WHITE.
ANGLE ON: With this light, he examines his surroundings. On
the far wall, he sees METAL BARS torn away from another
doorway. The doorway of a CRYPT.
Slowly, he steps forward on NARROW STONES set in the side of
the cavern. He reaches the crypt doorway and steps inside.

Suddenly, TWO BIRDS fly out of the broken tomb. Gandalf
gives a start, turning to look behind him. Radagast stands
at the crypt entrance.
GANDALF
Oh, it's you!
RADAGAST
Why am I here, Gandalf?
GANDALF
Trust me, Radagast, I would not
have called you here without good
reason.
Radagast removes his hat, letting the birds settle into the
nest lying on top of his head. Radagast replaces the hat,

If he had a name, it's long since
been lost. He would have only been

The Nine only answer to one master.
We've been blind, Radagast, and in

of the North is no ordinary hunter.
He is a commander, a commander of
legions. The enemy is preparing for
war. It will begin in the east. His
mind is set upon that mountain.

Radagast follows behind him.
RADAGAST
Where are you going?

Everyone, climb into the barrels!
Quickly!
DWALIN
Are you mad? They'll find us!
BILBO
No, no, they won't, I promise you.
Please, please, you must trust me!
The dwarves mill around, indecisive. Thorin and Bilbo
exchange glances. He turns to the others.

THORIN
Do as he says.
Without question, the dwarves begin to climb into the
barrels, hardly able to fit inside. Fili pops his head out
of his barrel.
FILI
What do we do now?
Bilbo stands beside a LARGE LEVER.
BILBO
Hold your breath.
FILI
Hold my breath? What do you mean?
Bilbo furiously pulls on the lever and floor beneath the
barrels OPENS UP. The dwarves are sent into the river below
with a SPLASH. The floor closes behind them. Bilbo stands
beside the lever, triumphant.

THORIN
Well done, Master Baggins.
Bilbo holds up his hand in thanks. Thorin turns to the other

CLOSE ON: HEAVILY ARMORED ELVES stand guard. One of the
elves pull a LEVER, closing the sluice gate.
THORIN
No!
The barrels come to a stop before the gate. Thorin grabs
onto the grate and pushes against it, DESPERATE as the other
barrels pile up.
ANGLE ON: The elves draw out their swords, ready to spring
into action.
Suddenly, an elf is shot in the back. He falls forward,
revealing an ORC crouched behind him. The orc SNARLS,
leading a TROOP OF ORCS onto the guardpost. They wipe out
the other elves.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo and the dwarves look up, surprised. The dead
elves begin to fall into the water.
FILI
Watch out! There's orcs!
ANGLE ON: From the riverbank, a MULTITUDE OF ORCS run out of
the bushes, led by Bolg.
BOLG
(in Black Speech;
subtitled)
Slay them all!
Orcs begin to throw themselves at the dwarves. Bilbo kills
several with Sting. The dwarves take the Orcish weapons,
using them to fend off the hoard of orcs.
CLOSE ON: Kili looks up, noticing the lever from above. He
gets out of his barrel and runs toward the lever.
DWALIN
Kili!
ANGLE ON: Dwalin throws Kili and ORC SWORD. Kili catches it,
cutting down orcs as he makes for the lever.
From the riverbank, ELVES have begun to come onto the scene.
Bolg crushes them with his MACE. Just then, he notices Kili
on the guardspost. Bolg pulls out a LARGE BOW, and readies
an arrow.

Kili reaches the lever. Suddenly, an arrow comes pelting
towards him. Ducking, he dodges the arrow and pulls the
lever.
WIDE ON: The sluice opens, letting the dwarves sail out into
the wild river.
From the riverbank, Bolg fires another arrow.
ANGLE ON: Kili dodges once again. Bolg fires a third arrow.
Kili expertly dodges for the third time. He jumps into his
barrel, floating down the forest river.
CLOSE ON: Bolg watches the dwarves sail away.
BOLG
(in Black Speech;
subtitled)
After them!
ANGLE ON: The orcs rush forward, following the river on
land.
The dwarves attempt to steer through the river to no avail.
The river is far too RAPID. They BOB UP AND DOWN the river,
waves crashing over them.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo hangs onto Oin's barrel for dear life,
COUGHING and SPLUTTERING all the while.
WIDE ON: Orcs from either side of the riverbank fire ARROW
AFTER ARROW at the Company.
Bilbo and the dwarves reach yet another waterfall. Water
SPLASHES OVER THEM. They reach the surface, nearly drowned.
Their eyes, ears and mouths FILLED WITH WATER.
ANGLE ON: From the guardpost, Tauriel and Legolas cut down
the orcs. Left and right, SLUMPED BODIES fall into the
river.
WIDE ON: The two elves jump over the guardpost, landing onto
the riverbank. Weapons raised, they race after Bolg and his
orcs.

away, and continues to speed down in the river.
ANGLE ON: Legolas and Tauriel draw out their bows. They take
out the ORC ARCHERS, never needing more than one arrow for

without mercy.
As the dwarves twist and turn down the river, dead orcs fall
into the river beside them. One orc makes to leap after
Balin from an OVERHANGING TREE BRANCH.
Mid-jump, Thorin throws his sword, pinning the orc to the
branch.
As they continue sailing down the river, the dwarves toss
weapons to one another, taking out an orc here and there.
An orc jumps forward and grabs onto Dwalin's barrel. He
headbutts the orc, sending it flying backwards. Dwalin
manages to catch its weapon. A STEEL AXE.
ANOTHER OVERHANGING BRANCH looms above them, this time with
nearly A DOZEN ORCS crouched on top.
THORIN
Cut the log!
Each passing dwarf cuts against the branch, until finally
Dwalin gives a MIGHTY SWING. The log breaks apart, falling
into the treacherous river.
An orc armed with a JAVELIN springs into the river. He leaps
onto Gloin's barrel, digging the javelin into the wood. They
go through a SMALL WATERFALL, sending the orc toppling
backwards.
Gloin's barrel sails above him. The tip of the javelin rips
through the orc, who crashes onto a rock. Gloin's barrel
flies through the air, flips over a log, and finally
SPLASHES back into the water.
WIDE ON: The elves have caught up with the dwarves. They
fight beside them on the riverbank, sending a multitude of
dead orcs spiraling down into the river.
ANGLE ON: Legolas jumps over the river, his two feet landing
on the heads of Fili and Dwalin.
He sails down the river with this vantage point, shooting
down orcs on both sides of the river. Aiming carefully, he
manages to skewer two orcs with the SAME ARROW.
Satisfied, he leaps forward and lands on the riverbank. He
slides down the hillside, using a dead orc as a board.
Legolas strides across the river again, using the dwarves as
stepping stones.

He reaches the top of the riverbank, fighting off the last
remaining orcs. From behind him, an orc stealthily.
From the river, Thorin throws his sword. It cuts down the
orc behind Legolas. Legolas locks eyes with him, surprised.
Thorin scowls over at him, until he and the dwarves round a
corner. They are out of Thranduil's lands.
WIDE ON: Bolg and the last dozen orcs race after the
dwarves.
BOLG
(in Black Speech;

the river. A SLAB OF ROCK juts out of the water nearby.
THORIN
Anything behind us?
BALIN
Not that I can see.
FILI
I think we've outrun the orcs.
THORIN
Not for long. We've lost the
current.
OIN
Gloin is half drowned.

BILBO
The mountain, we're so close.
BALIN
A lake lies between us and that
mountain. We have no way to cross
it.
BILBO
So then we go around.
DWALIN
The orcs will run us down, as sure
as daylight. We have no weapons to
defend ourselves.
CLOSE ON: Thorin nods, troubled. He turns to Fili.
THORIN
Fili, you have two minutes.
ANGLE ON: Relieved, Fili empties his water-filled boot into
the river. Slowly, a BOWMAN steps forward on the rocks above
the Company. He raises his bow, aiming towards Fili.
The dwarves look up, startled. Dwalin steps in front of
Fili, holding out a BRANCH in front of him. He GROWLS.
The Bowman fires the arrow, which lands straight in the
branch. Kili raises a rock above his head, but the Bowman
shoots it out of his hand.
BOWMAN
Do it again, and you're dead.
Balin looks past the man, seeing a BARGE tethered into a
near DOCK. He approaches the Bowman, arms raised.
BALIN
Excuse me, but you're from
Laketown, if I'm not mistaken? That
barge over there, it wouldn't be
available for hire, by any chance?

THUNDER!
FADE IN:
EXT. PRANCING PONY, BREE STREETS - NIGHT
A CLOAKED FIGURE hurries through a heavy downpour towards the
LIGHT of an INN. A SIGN SWINGS in the WIND: “The Prancing
Pony”
The CLOAKED FIGURE goes to step into the shelter of the INN
but suddenly turns and looks over his shoulder, as if sensing
something ... the FIGURE is THORIN OAKENSHIELD.
THORIN stares out into the dark, wind swept night, before
hurrying inside.
PULL BACK to reveal ... TWO SWARTHY looking men exchange looks
before following him in.
INT. PRANCING PONY - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: an assortment of locals and travellers fills the
bar. HOBBITS, mingle with BREELANDERS.
A BARMAID, BETSY BUTTERBUR, is just about to deliver a MUG and
a PLATE of CHEESE and BREAD to THORIN.
A LARGE FIGURE suddenly sits down across the TABLE from THORIN
... this is GANDALF the GREY. He looks a little the worse for
wear.
GANDALF
Mind if I join you?
(signalling to the BARMAID)
I’ll have the same.
(back to THORIN)
I should introduce myself - my name is
Gandalf, Gandalf the Grey.
THORIN
I know who you are.
GANDALF

Well now ... this is a fine chance ...

What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?
ANGLE ON: THORIN stares speculatively at the WIZARD before
deciding to answer.MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
THORIN
I received word that my father had been
seen, wandering the wilds near Dunland. I
went looking, but found no sign of him.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks at THORIN with sympathy.
GANDALF
Thorin it has been a long time since
anything but rumour was heard of Thrain.
THORIN
He still lives - I’m sure of it.
GANDALF shifts in his seat.
ANGLE ON: BETSY BUTTERBUR the BARMAID places GANDALF’s MUG of
ALE and CHEESE and BREAD in front of him.
THORIN (CONT’D)
My father came to see you - before he
went missing. What did you tell him?
GANDALF
I urged him to march upon Erebor ... to
rally the seven armies of the Dwarves,
destroy the Dragon and take back Erebor.
... I would say the same to you - take
back your homeland.
THORIN takes a swig of BEER. He regards GANDALF.
THORIN
This is no chance meeting - is it?
GANDALF
(conceding the truth)
No - it is not.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
The Lonely Mountain troubles me, Thorin.
That Dragon has sat there long enough.
Sooner or later ... darker minds will
turn towards Erebor -
THORIN looks at GANDALF, unconvinced.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
I ran into some unsavoury characters
whilst travelling along the Greenway.
They mistook me for a vagabond.
THORIN
I imagine they regretted that.
GANDALF smiles wryly. He reaches into his pocket and withdraws
a tattered note. He slides it towards THORIN
2MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
GANDALF
One of them was carrying a message.
THORIN opens the bit of OLD PIECE OF HIDE, he frowns, unable
to read the script.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
It is Black Speech - a promise of
payment.
THORIN
For what?
GANDALF
Your head.
CLOSE ON: THORIN reacts to this unwelcome news.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
Someone wants you dead ... Thorin, you
can wait no longer. You are the heir to
the Throne of Durin. Your father will
never be found - this task is now yours.
Unite the armies of the Dwarves -
together you have the might and power to
retake Erebor. Summon a meeting of the
seven Dwarf families - demand that they
stand by their oath.
THORIN
The seven armies swore that oath to the
one who wields the King’s Jewel, the
Arkenstone ... It is the only thing that
will unite them. In case you have
forgotten that jewel was stolen by Smaug.
ANGLE ON: The SWARTHY MEN slip out of the INN. GANDALF leans
forward.
GANDALF
(low voice)
What if I were to help you reclaim it?
THORIN
How? The Arkenstone lies half a world
away, buried beneath the feet of a fire
breathing dragon.
GANDALF
Yes, it does. Which is why we are going
to need a burglar.

escarpment ... cautiously he peers over the edge.
SUPER IMPOSE: NINE MONTHS LATER ...

WARGS can be seen scouring a RIDGE LINE ... the WARG’S sniff
the ground trying to pick-up THORIN and COMPANIES scent.
ANGLE ON: the MENACING FORM of AZOG the DEFILER rides into
view ... AZOG’s head swivels towards BILBO’s lookout as if
sensing he is being watched. BILBO ducks down just before he
is seen.
ANGLE ON: BILBO about to creep back to the OTHERS when
suddenly he freezes ... THUD! A MASSIVE PAW pads into view as
the ENORMOUS FUR COVERED BODY of a GIANT BEAR CREATURE pushes
through UNDERGROWTH ... dark, fierce eyes stares intently at
the ORC PACK in the distance ... sharp, fangs are bared as the
CREATURE emits a LOW, THREATENING SNARL ...
Barely breathing BILBO quietly slips away.
EXT. ANDUIN VALLEY CLEARING - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: GANDALF, THORIN and the COMPANY reacts as BILBO
scampers into the clearing. He is immediately peppered with
questions.
THORIN
How close is the pack?
BILBO
(out of breath)
Too close, a couple of leagues, no more.
But that’s not the worst of it -
DWALIN
(interrupting)
Have the Wargs picked up our scent?
BILBO
Not yet, they will soon enough - but
there’s another problem -
GANDALF
(alarmed)
Did they see you? They saw you.
BILBO
No, it’s not that -
GANDALF
(interrupting)
What did I tell you? Quiet as a mouse -
excellent burglar material.

ignore BILBO and confer amongst themselves

BOFUR (CONT’D)
I say we go back.
THORIN
And be run down by a pack of Orcs?
GANDALF
(thinking fast)
There’s a house not far from here where
we might seek refuge.
THORIN
(wary)
Whose house? Are they friend or foe?
GANDALF
Neither - he will help us ... or he
will kill us.
THORIN
What choice do we have?
A HUGE ROAR sounds above them.
GANDALF
None.

WOODEN HOUSE ... BOMBUR puts on a surprising burst of SPEED!
The BEAR-CREATURE is SNARLING at their HEELS!

help the SMALL HOBBIT.
BOFUR arrives at the HOUSE FIRST, and tries the DOOR: LOCKED!
NORI steps forward, producing a thin file and proceeds to try
to pick the lock!
BOFUR
Come on, come on!

BEAR-CREATURE not far behind!

DWALIN drops a MASSIVE wooden BOLT across the DOOR ... they
listen to the BEAR-CREATURE RIPPING at the door with his
CLAWS.

EXT. BEORN’S HOUSE - NIGHT
IMAGES: SLEEK BLACK FUR, GIANT CLAWS, SNARLING JAWS ... the
HUGE, SWAYING BODY of a BEAR as it furiously scratches at the
DOOR and the SIDES of the HOUSE.
GANDALF (O.S.)
His name is Beorn and he is a skin-
changer ... Sometimes he’s a huge black
bear, sometimes he is a great, strong
man. The bear is unpredictable, but the
man can be reasoned with ... however, he
is not over fond of Dwarves.
ORI
(peering through crack)
He’s leaving.
DORI
Get away from there - it’s not natural,
none of it. It’s obvious he’s under some
dark spell.
GANDALF
Don’t be a fool! He’s under no
enchantment other than his own! Now get
some sleep, all of you. You’ll be safe
here tonight.
(quietly to himself)
I hope.

A GIANT HONEY BEE, the size of a SPARROW settles on his NOSE!

BILBO suddenly sits up, and waves his arms around, scaring the
BEES away ... he is ALONE.

CLOSE ON: MILK being poured into FILI’s MUG. The COMPANY are
seated at the long wooden table, the remains of a simple meal
laid out in front of them ... bread, cheese, fruits and nuts,
honey and mead.
BEORN
You are the one they call Oakenshield.
Tell me, why is Azog the Defiler hunting
you?
THORIN
You know of Azog? How?
BEORN stirs a log in the FIRE PIT with his foot.
BEORN
My people were the first to live in the
mountains, before the Orcs came down from
the north. The Defiler killed most of my
family - but some he enslaved. Not for
work, you understand ... but for sport.
BILBO’s eyes stray to an ORC MANACLE that is still attached to
BEORN’s ARM ...
BEORN (CONT’D)
Caging a skin-changer and torturing them
seemed to amuse him.

Which is why we must go through Mirkwood.

Safe? The Wood Elves of Mirkwood are not
like their kin - they are less wise and
more dangerous. But it matters not.
THORIN
(tense)
What do you mean?
BEORN
These lands are crawling with Orcs. Their
numbers are growing ... you are on foot
... you will never reach the forest
alive.
THORIN exchanges a worried look with GANDALF ...
BEORN seems to come to a decision.
BEORN (CONT’D)
I don’t like Dwarves. They are greedy ...
ANGLE ON: BEORN scoops up a SMALL FIELD MOUSE from the TABLE
that DWALIN has been trying to brush aside.

BEORN (CONT’D)
... and blind to the lives of those they
deem lesser than their own.
BEORN gently places the SMALL FIELD MOUSE on a SHELF.
BEORN (CONT’D)
But Orcs, I hate more ...
(to THORIN)
What do you need?
EXT. AUDUIN GRASSLANDS - DAY
ANGLE ON: THORIN and the COMPANY climb onto BEORN’S PONIES.
BEORN
(urgent)
Go, now while you have the light.
BEORN watches as GANDALF, the DWARVES and BILBO ride away.
BEORN (CONT’D)
Your hunters are not far behind.
BEORN looks westward suddenly, as if picking up a scent on the
air.
EXT. ANDUIN GRASSLANDS - DAY
MONTAGE: The COMPANY ride fast across deserted GRASSLAND ...
GANDALF on horseback with BILBO perched in front of him, the
DWARVES following behind riding BEORN’S sturdy PONIES.
IMAGES: the looming FOREST of MIRKWOOD getting closer and
closer ...
EXT. MIRKWOOD FOREST GATE - DAY
WIDE ON: The COMPANY cautiously approach the forest eaves ...
huge GNARLED TRUNKS, twisted BRANCHES, with DARK LEAVES and
crawling IVY.
ANGLE ON: the ROTTEN REMAINS of an old ELVEN ARCH stand on the
FOREST EDGE ... it leads into a tunnel made of great trees
leaning together, old and strangled by creepers with blackened
leaves.
GANDALF
The Elven Gate. Here lies the path
through Mirkwood.
GANDALF turns back to the DWARVES and BILBO.
DWALIN
No sign of the Orcs ... we have luck on
our side.
12MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
ANGLE ON: GANDALF smiles to himself ... looks towards the
south:
ANGLE ON: the figure of the BEAR watches over them from a
DISTANT RIDGE.
GANDALF
Set the ponies loose, let them return to
their Master.
ANGLES ON: The DWARVES unsaddle the PONIES, dividing up the
supplies between them.
CLOSE ON: BILBO stares through the ELVEN GATE, into the
DARKNESS beyond ... unconsciously his hand reaches into his
pocket taking out a SMALL, GOLD RING ... nervously he turns
the RING over in his fingers.
BILBO
The forest feels ... sick. Like a disease
lies upon it.
(nervous)
Is there no other way around?
GANDALF
(following his GAZE)
Not unless we go two hundred miles North
and twice that distance, South ...
GANDALF has seen something ... the shape of a DARK FIGURE
seems to be watching them from just inside the forest.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF carefully moves forward to get a better look
... in his mind’s eye he can hear a VOICE:
GALADRIEL (V.O.)
Something moves in the shadows ...
unseen, hidden from our sight.
CLOSE ON: BILBO turning the SMALL GOLD RING over and over
between his fingers ... a WHISPERING builds in his head.
GANDALF moving slowly forward - the SHADOWY FIGURE seems to
grow in SIZE ... he raises his STAFF in readiness.
GALADRIEL (V.O.)
Every day it grows in strength. Beware
The Necromancer... he is not what he
seems.
CLOSE ON: GANDALF goes to walk away, but some instinct makes
him turn back ... his hand pushing aside the creeper ...
CLOSE ON: a FIRE RED EYE - a crudely drawn SYMBOL on the
STATUE!
13MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
GALADRIEL (V.O.)
(PSYCHIC SPEECH)
If our Enemy has returned - we must know.
Go to the tombs in the mountains.
CLOSE ON: GANDALF as he understands GALADRIEL’s meaning.
GANDALF
(to himself)
The High Fells ... so be it.
GANDALF calls to NORI who is just about to turn the large
horse, loose.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
Not my horse - I need it!
The DWARVES and BILBO stare in disbelief.
BILBO
You’re leaving us?
GANDALF
(hurriedly)
I would not do this unless I had to.
GANDALF stops ... something makes him glance down at BILBO. He
stares down at the HOBBIT as if sensing something unfamiliar
about him.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
You have changed, Bilbo Baggins ... you
are not the same Hobbit as the one who
left The Shire.
CLOSE ON: BILBO’S fingers CLOSE around the RING, behind his
BACK ... well out of GANDALF’S sight.
BILBO
(hesitant)
I was going to tell you -
GANDALF
Tell me what?
BILBO
(awkward)
I found something ... in the Goblin
tunnels.
GANDALF
Found what? What did you find?
For a second BILBO cannot say anything ... he is torn between
his attachment to THE RING and his loyalty to GANDALF.
BILBO
My courage.
14MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
GANDALF looks into BILBO’S EYES.
GANDALF
Good, that is good. You will need it.
GANDALF turns to THORIN.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
I will be waiting for you at the Overlook
before the slopes of Erebor. Keep the map
and key safe. Do not enter that Mountain
without me.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF holding the REINS to the HORSE ready to
MOUNT.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
This is not the Greenwood of old. The
very air of the forest is heavy with
illusion, it will seek to enter your mind
and lead you astray.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF MOUNTS his HORSE.
BILBO
Lead us astray? What does that mean ...?
GANDALF
Stay on the path, do not leave it
- if you do, you will never find it
again.
GANDALF wheels his HORSE around.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
(calling in warning)
No matter what may come stay on the path!
THORIN calls to the others as he turns for the ELVEN GATE.
THORIN
Come on - we must reach Erebor before the
sun sets on Durin’s Day. It is our one
chance to find the hidden door into the
Mountain... We have three days to cross
this forest!
ANGLE ON: THORIN and COMPANY as they disappear through the
DARK, ELVEN GATE into the GLOOM of MIRKWOOD!
EXT. MIRKWOOD PATHWAY - DAY
TRACKING: as THORIN leads the COMPANY through the TWISTED
GLOOM of MIRKWOOD FOREST ... the PATH twists and turns down
GULLYS and RAVINES, passing through TUNNELS carved into HUGE
TREES.

THORIN
The path turns this way - follow me!
EXT. MIRKWOOD FOREST - DAY
ANGLE ON: NORI is leading the COMPANY through the FOREST. The
effect of the strange air, is beginning to show.
BOFUR
Air, I need some air -
OIN
My head - it’s swimming. What’s
happening?
THORIN
(urgent)
Keep moving! Nori, why have we stopped?
ANGLE ON: NORI is staring ahead in to a FOREST CLEARING.
NORI
The path - it’s disappeared.
THORIN looks around.
DWALIN
What’s going on?
OIN
We’ve lost the path!
THORIN
Find it! All of you - look; look for the
path!
PAN ACROSS ... to the FOREST FLOOR ... the stone pathway along
with an MILESTONE lies off to the left ... unbeknownst to THE
COMPANY they have left the ELVEN ROAD!
ANGLE ON: BILBO and the DWARVES staring all around ... there
nothing but dense, dark, black WOODLAND ... there is no PATH!
ANGLE ON: BILBO and the DWARVES are perched high on a rocky
outcrop, dazed and confused.
BALIN
I don’t remember any of this - none of
it’s familiar.
DORI
It’s got to be here -
THORIN
What hour is it?
16MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
DWALIN
I do no know ... I do not even know what
day it is.
THORIN
Is there no end to this accursed forest?
GLOIN
Only trees and more trees.
ANGLE ON: BILBO ... he stares at the large, thick cobwebs
which seem to be everywhere ... he plucks at the sticky thread
... a strange whispering echoes through the forest.
EXT. MIRKWOOD - DAY
The DWARVES wander through the FOREST trying to find a way
out. They are clearly falling under an enchantment.
BILBO looks back to the DWARVES, DORI is right behind him.
When he takes another look he sees HIMSELF.
BILBO rounds a corner and seems to FLOAT as he walks along the
SICKLY cob-webbed FOREST.
EXT. MIRKWOOD TREES - DUSK
ANGLE ON: BILBO, DORI, OIN and BALIN are wandering aimlessly
through the forest behind the others. BILBO looks down at his
feet only to discover he is WALKING BACKWARDS! ...
ORI picks something up off the GROUND.
ORI
Look!
DORI
A tobacco pouch! There’s Dwarves in these
woods!
BOFUR
Dwarves from the Blue Mountains, no less.
This is exactly like mine!
BILBO
Because it is yours! You understand? We
are going ‘round in circles. We’re lost!
THORIN
We are not lost!

OIN
Aye, but which way is East? We’ve lost
the sun.
DWALIN
(picking a fight)
I thought you were the expert -
CLOSE ON: BILBO staring up the dizzying height of the TALL
TREE. A patch of pale, golden SKY glimmers above.
ALL around BILBO the DWARVES argue amongst themselves:
“There’s no light”; “We’ve been led astray”; Beneath the angry
voices, the low, scratchy whisper can be heard.
BILBO
(to himself)
Sun ... we have to find the sun. Up
there!
(to the others)
We need to get above the canopy -
THE DWARVES pay no attention, continuing to argue. THORIN
senses something.
THORIN
Whispering ... what was that?
(yelling)
Enough! Be quiet - all of you!
A STUNNED SILENCE. The DWARVES look at THORIN.
PUSH IN on THORIN ... sudden realisation.

EXT. MIRKWOOD FOREST CANOPY - DUSK
CLOSE ON: BILBO’S ARM reaches up from the CANOPY of LEAVES and
grabs the TOPMOST BRANCH ... followed by his HEAD. He looks
around:
WIDE ON: the TOP of the CANOPY is a BRIGHT, COLOURFUL, MAGICAL
place! The SETTING SUN lights everything in a GOLDEN HAZE, a
sea of RED and YELLOW LEAVES ruffle in the BREEZE.
BILBO shuts his eyes and shakes his head, as if to clear his
head. For a moment, enjoys the fresh BREEZE blowing through
his HAIR.
18MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
A CLOUD of hundreds of BRIGHT BUTTERFLIES rise from the CANOPY
and flutter around BILBO.
Distant MOUNTAINS rise to the WEST ... BILBO checks the
SETTING SUN.

I can see the lake ... far, far away. And
a river! And the Lonely Mountain! We’re
almost there!
(calling again)

his FEET are BOUND in a sticky WEB-LIKE SILK!
Unable to move his FEET, BILBO TOPPLES out of the TREE!
BILBO is falling, crashing through BRANCHES ...He GRABS at the
NEAREST BRANCH, only to discover it is in fact, a HUGE SPIDER
LEG! The SPIDER SPRINGS towards him, terrified BILBO lets go &
FALLS backwards into a HUGE WEB ...
CLOSE ON: BILBO looks up in horror as ... a HUGE, GIANT SPIDER
scuttles across the web towards him and encases BILBO in a
STICKY COCOON.
EXT. MIRKWOOD TREE BRANCHES - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: A LARGE FAT SPIDER is DRAGGING BILBO’S COCOON along
a WIDE BRANCH ...
CLOSE ON: BILBO’S EYES OPEN .. He is ENCASED in a TIGHT WEB
COCOON, barely able to breath through his MOUTH and NOSE.
ANGLE ON: SUDDENLY BILBO thrusts his SWORD up through COCOON
and into the SPIDER. THE SPIDER struggles and then RECOILS,
tumbling DOWNWARDS.
CLOSE ON: BILBO tears through the WEB ... he SLIDES OUT of his
COCOON, and QUIETLY drops to the GROUND, ducking behind a
TRUNK ... and PEERING OUT.
ANGLE ON: a DOZEN BUNDLES wrapped tightly in COBWEBS, dangle
in a ROW from a HIGH BRANCH ... DWARFISH FEET stick out of
some, others have a protruding NOSE or BEARD visible ...

SLIPS it on ... he instantly DISAPPEARS.

Arccch! The meat’s alive and kicking!
The SPIDERS cackle in a thin, creaking way.
SPIDER #1
(psychic whispers)
Kill them, kill them! Let us feast!
ANGLE ON: BILBO ... he must ACT FAST, but he’s too far away to
use his SWORD. BILBO snatches up a broken piece of branch,
hurls it deep into the FOREST ... it CLATTERS off a distant
TREE.
The SPIDERS instantly REACT, thinking there is MORE PREY ...
ANGLE ON: BILBO starts moving towards the DWARVES ... an SLOW,
OLD WICKED FAT-BODIED SPIDER is GREEDILY pinching each DWARF
to find out which is the JUICIEST to EAT.
SPIDER #3
Mine ... fat and juicy ... just a little
taste.
BILBO rushes along the BRANCHES ... he grips his SWORD and
SWINGS at the SPIDER’S BODY from behind! The SPIDER flinches
in PAIN, spinning around.

The OLD SPIDER charges forward, BILBO stabs at it.

It stings! It stings! Stings!
THUD! THE OLD SPIDER FALLS to the GROUND, DEAD, LEGS curled
up. BILBO looks at his SWORD, glinting in the darkness.
BILBO
“Sting”, that’s a good name! “Sting”.
ANGLE ON: BILBO QUICKLY slashes at the COCOONS holding the
DWARVES ... the COCOONS separate from the BRANCH and TUMBLE
gently towards the GROUND on the end of the ELASTIC WEBBING.
ANGLE ON: the DWARVES lying on the FOREST FLOOR in their
ripped and torn COCOONS ... they start to STIR back into
CONSCIOUSNESS.
CLOSE ON: BILBO is about to CLIMB DOWN, when he FREEZES in
HORROR!
ANGLE ON: A SPIDER SPRINGS towards him across BRANCHES and
WEB!
The SPIDER ENCOMPASSES BILBO and they BOTH TUMBLE DOWNWARDS.
As they FALL, the RING slips from his POCKET and drops through
the BRANCHES!

the GROUND he immediately begins searching desperately for the
RING!

it lies a distance away from him on the FOREST FLOOR.
... a LARGE INSECT CREATURE climbs out of a HOLE, next to the
RING.
BILBO FIGHTS his way towards the RING, as if FUELLED by a
MANIC ENERGY ... he CUTS DOWN the CREATURE, IMPALING IT to the
GROUND.
BILBO snatches up the RING, cradling it to himself.
BILBO

BILBO stops himself ... realising what he has just said. It’s
as if the voice of GOLLUM echoes back at him ... “It’s mine,
my own, my precious”. BILBO stares at the RING in horror.

slay a dragon.

THORIN looks at THRANDUIL sharply. THRANDUIL, smiles to
himself, leaning down close to THORIN.
THRANDUIL (CONT’D)
You have found a way in.
The ELVENKING’S voice is soft and seductive, almost
sympathetic to THORIN’s plight.
THRANDUIL (CONT’D)
You seek that which will bestow upon you
the right to rule - the King’s Jewel, the

measure, I understand that. There are
gems in that Mountain that I too desire -
white gems, of pure starlight. I offer
you my help.

moment terrible scars can be seen running down his face and
his neck, he looks older and more dangerous.

Do not talk to me of dragon fire - I know
it’s wrath and ruin. I have faced the

THRANDUIL
No. That fortress lies beyond our
borders. Keep our lands clear of these
foul creatures, that is your task.
TAURIEL
When we drive them off, what happens
then? Will they not spread to other
lands?
INVISIBLE BILBO quietly edges past the ELVES, intent on
reaching a doorway across the chamber.
THRANDUIL
Other lands are not my concern. The
fortunes of the world will rise and fall -
but here, in this Kingdom, we will
endure.
TAURIEL bows, unconvinced.
THRANDUIL hesitates, as if sensing something. His eyes swivel
towards BILBO ... as he slips through the doorway.
THRANDUIL turns back to TAURIEL, his eyes a little softer.
THRANDUIL (CONT’D)
Legolas said you fought well today ... He
has grown very fond of you.
TAURIEL
(smiling)
I assure you My Lord, Legolas thinks of
me as no more than a Captain in the
Guard.
THRANDUIL
Perhaps he did once, but now I am not so
sure.
29MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
TAURIEL
I do not think you would allow your son
to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.
THRANDUIL
No - you are right. I would not. Still -
he cares about you - do not give him hope
when there is none.
EXT. MIRKWOOD - NIGHT
WIDE ON: ... In the MOONLIGHT BOLG leads the WARG PACK towards
an outcrop overlooking the ENTRANCE to the WOODLAND REALM.
BOLG turns to NARZUG.

The gates are guarded. Not all of them -
follow me!
INT. KILI’S CELL, WOODLAND REALM - NIGHT
HIGH ANGLE POV: KILI is sitting on the floor of his cell,
leaning back against the rock wall ...
Between his fingers he absentmindedly turns a small, ROUGH-
HEWN GEMSTONE ...
TAURIEL
The stone in your hand, what is it?
ANGLE ON: TAURIEL steps forward into the soft, amber light
that flickers from nearby lamps ... KILI’s fingers tighten
around the STONE. He stares at TAURIEL, his eyes full of
urgency and fear.
KILI
It is a talisman; a powerful spell lies
upon it, if any but a dwarf read the
runes on this stone they will be forever
cursed ...
TAURIEL looks at KILI sharply ... holding his gaze until the
tell-tale grin creeps into KILI’s eyes.
KILI (CONT’D)
Or not ... depending on whether you
believe in that kind of thing.
(opening his fist to reveal the
SMALL STONE)
It’s just a token - a rune stone. My
mother gave it to me so I would remember
my promise.
30MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
TAURIEL stares down at the STONE in KILI’s hand. Light ripples
over the dark surface of the stone to reveal simple runes.
TAURIEL
What promise?
KILI
That I would come back to her. She
worries, she thinks I’m reckless ...
TAURIEL
Are you?
KILI
Nah -
KILI flips the RUNE STONE lightly in the air, but misses
catching it ... the SMALL STONE skids across the floor and
nearly plummets over the edge into a dark CHASM ... TAURIEL
stops it. She looks at it briefly, before handing it to KILI.
KILI (CONT’D)
Sounds like quite a party you’re having
up there.
TAURIEL
It is Mereth e-nGilith - the Feast of
Starlight.
TAURIEL hesitates, KILI is patient, quietly she speaks.
TAURIEL (CONT’D)
All light is sacred to the Eldar, but
Wood Elves love best the light of the
stars.
KILI
I have always thought it is a cold light,
remote and far away.
TAURIEL
It is memory - precious and pure ... like
your promise. I have walked there,
sometimes - beyond the forest, up into
the night ... I have seen the world fall
away and the white light of forever fill
the air.
As TAURIEL talks a soft white light seems to glow around her.
KILI
I saw a fire-moon once.
TAURIEL says nothing, but sits on the floor near his cell ...
she listens as KILI tells her of the places he has been and
sights he has seen.
31MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
KILI (CONT’D)
It rose over the pass near Dunland ...
Huge and red gold it was. It filled the
sky ...
The CAMERA slowly pulls back to reveal a TALL FIGURE watching
them from the SHADOWS ... it is LEGOLAS.
INT. THRANDUIL’S WINE CELLARS - DUSK
MOVING POV: moving down a NARROW CORRIDOR ... past a PASSAGE
leading to the CELLS ... into a VAULTED WINE CELLAR ... a VAST
STOCKPILE of BARRELS and CASTS for THRANDUIL’S dining
pleasure.
ELROS strides into the room, searching around.
ELROS
Galion, you old rogue, we are running out
of drink - these empty barrels should
have been sent back to Esgaroth hours
ago. The bargemen will be waiting for
them.
GALION, the KING’S BUTLER, has an open FLAGON of RED WINE in
one hand.
ANGLE ON: AN INVISIBLE BILBO peers from behind cover.
GALION nudges a STOOL with his foot towards ELROS.
GALION
Say what you like about our ill-tempered
King, but he has excellent taste in wine.
Come - Elros, try it. Such a draught is
worthy of respect.
ANGLE ON: ELROS, hesitates, his hand strays to the a GREAT
BUNDLE of KEYS which hang from his belt.
ELROS
I have the Dwarves in my charge.
GALION
They are locked up - where can they go?!
ANGLE ON: ELROS laughs, hanging the BUNDLE of KEYS on a hook
nearby he sits. Clinking his FLAGON against GALION’S, ELROS
takes a LONG SWIG ... before coughing.
CLOSE ON: the KEYS DANGLING from the HOOK on the WALL.

I’ll wager the sun is on the rise ... it
must be nearly dawn ...
ANGLE ON: ORI voices the unspoken thought.
ORI
We’re never going to reach the Mountain,
are we?
SILENCE ...
BILBO
Not stuck in here, you’re not.
THORIN looks up!
AT THAT MOMENT: BILBO APPEARS outside THORIN’s door, the BUNCH
of KEYS in his hand.
SLIPPING the RING in his POCKET BILBO begins to UNLOCK the
CELL DOORS, starting with BALIN.
VARIOUS DWARVES
(startled)
Bilbo!
BILBO
(warning)
Shhh - there are guards nearby!
QUICK IMAGES: BILBO moving swiftly, opening cell doors ...
ANGLE ON: THORIN herds the COMPANY towards the STAIRS that
lead up towards the UPPER HALLS.
THORIN
Up the stairs! Go!
BILBO
Not that way - down here. Follow me!
The DWARVES all stare at BILBO who is already hurrying down
stairs that lead deep into the DARK CHASM.
INT. ELVISH WINE CELLAR, WOODLAND REALM - NIGHT
ANGLES ON: The DWARVES move QUIETLY ... SOUNDS of DISTANT
MERRY-MAKING drift down from above.
BILBO
This way ...
ANGLE ON: GALION and ELROS are lying ASLEEP in the WINE
CELLAR, empty FLAGONS gripped in their UNCONSCIOUS hands!
CLOSE ON: FILI and KILI looking around the CELLAR, there is no
way out!
33MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
KILI
I don’t believe it - we’re in the
cellars.
BOFUR
You were supposed to be leading us out -
not further in!
BILBO
(whisper)
I know what I’m doing.
BILBO gestures towards the STACK of EMPTY BARRELS.
ANGLE ON: BALIN looking around - all he can see is EMPTY
BARRELS.
BILBO (CONT’D)
(urgently)
Everyone ... climb into the barrels -
quickly.
DWALIN
Are you mad? They’ll find us
-
BILBO
No, they won’t - I promise. Please ...
you must trust me.
SOUNDS of APPROACHING VOICES!
THORIN looks at BILBO a beat, and then nods.
THORIN
Do as he says.
ANGLE ON: MUTTERING under their breath, the DWARVES scramble
into the BARRELS. Even BOMBUR manages to squeeze into a LARGE
one, although the METAL RINGS are under great strain.
ANGLE ON: BILBO hurries over to a WOODEN, LEVER that protrudes
from the CELLAR WALL ... BOFUR’s head pops out from the
BARREL.
BOFUR
What do we do now?
BILBO
Hold your breath -
BILBO pulls on the GREAT LEVER with all his might ...
BOFUR
Hold my breath? What do you mean?
Waiaiaiaiaiaiaiai!!!!!
THE DWARVES yell as, SUDDENLY, the entire floor beneath the
STACK of BARRELS, RISES and TILTS ... revealing, beneath the
CELLARS ...
34MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
... the RUSHING WATER of an UNDERGROUND STREAM! The BARRELS
slide, plummeting down into the CHURNING DEPTHS!
BILBO looks triumphant for a second before realising that the
TRAPDOOR has shut! Desperately he tries to open it, stamping
on it, jumping up and down!
INT. UNDERGROUND BARREL FLUME, WOODLAND REALM - DAWN
QUICK ANGLES: the BARRELS are TUMBLING around in a SLOW
FLOWING WATER CHANNEL, like a NARROW CANAL ... a FEW DWARFS
risk a PEEK and LIFT their barrel LIDS. They are passing
through an UNDERGROUND CAVERN beneath the FORTRESS.
INT. WOODLAND REALM CELLS - DAWN

OPEN! The ALARM goes out!
TAURIEL
Where is the Keeper of the Keys?
INT. ELVISH WINE CELLAR, WOODLAND REALM - DAWN
Noises can be heard coming from above ... BILBO looks up -
someone is coming!
TAURIEL races down the STAIRS into the CELLAR just as BILBO
escapes down the TRAP DOOR!
INT. BARREL FLUME, WOODLAND REALM - DAY
CLOSE ON: BILBO is HOLDING NORI’S BARREL ... he COUGHS and
SPLUTTERS as water goes into his MOUTH. THORIN tries to HAUL
him up to a safer position.
THORIN
Well done Master Baggins!
INT. BARREL FLUME, WOODLAND REALM - DAY
WIDE ON: the BARRELS are floating in single FILE ... the WATER
is picking up SPEED, causing BARRELS to THUD TOGETHER.

over a SMALL WATERFALL in the natural rock CAVERN.

The BARRELS FLOAT towards a NARROW CHANNEL, leading to a FAST
FLOWING WATERWAY that heads off down the WOODED HILLSIDE ...
an IRON PORTCULLIS above the CHANNEL ENTRANCE is OPEN.
INSERT: LEGOLAS arrives on a LEDGE overlooking the RIVER,
another ELF by his side.
LEGOLAS
(ELVISH unsubtitled)
Holo in-annon!
Close the gate!
The ELF blows a long note on a TRUMPET.
ELVEN SENTRIES leap into action, CLOSING the PORTCULLIS.
ANGLE ON: THORIN’S BARREL almost slips through the PORTCULLIS
GATES, but gets JAMMED ... the remaining BARRELS crash into
it, BOBBING and CRACKING against each other ... they can go NO
FURTHER!
THWACK! One of the ELVISH GUARD falls down dead.
SUDDENLY - a large FORCE of ORCS is SWARMING over the
RIVERBANK lead by BOLG.
BOLG
(BLACK SPEECH with subtitles)
Goridug!
Slay them all!
EXT. BARREL FLUME, WOODLAND REALM - DAY
WITHIN MOMENTS: the BARRELS are attacked by ORCS ... a
desperate struggle begins. DWARVES use BARREL LIDS to stop ORC
ARROWS ... ORCS leap onto BARRELS, and soon BILBO and the
DWARVES are FIGHTING for their lives!
ANGLE ON: KILI makes a dash for the LEVER to open the
PORTCULLIS! He fights off several ORCS and reaches the LEVER!
CLOSE ON: BOLG lines KILI up in his sights.
THWACK! An arrow lands in KILI’s LEG.

LEGOLAS leading a group of ELVEN WARRIORS ... SWORDS DRAWN,
with a FLASH OF STEEL, they charge into the ORC FORCE!
TAURIEL is cutting ORCS DOWN with a wicked CURVED ELVEN KNIVES
in each hand ... she TWISTS and SPINS like an acrobat.
LEGOLAS fights with incredible skill.
KILI struggles to his feet and releases the PORTCULLIS ... he
leaps for his BARREL just before the DWARVES disappear from
view.
BOLG (CONT’D)
(BLACK SPEECH with subtitles)
Abgurid! Gur!
After them Go!
TAURIEL AND LEGOLAS dispatch the ORCS at the GATE with lethal
skill and then set off in PURSUIT of THE DWARVES, slaying ORCS
as the go.
The DWARVES continue to fend off ORCS as the CURRENT SPINS &
CHURNS them away from the WOODLAND REALM. BILBO clings on, as
the BARRELS sail over a HIGH WATERFALL towards the RIVER
BELOW.
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS watches as the DWARVISH BARRELS spin away
down the RIVER at SPEED.
NARZUG creeps up behind LEGOLAS ready to strike - SUDDENLY a
FIGURE falls upon him - it is TAURIEL, she easily overcomes
the ORC, pulling a knife to his throat, ready to slit it -

EXT. HIGH FELLS TOMBS, MISTY MOUNTAINS - DAY
ANGLE ON: GANDALF climbing a STEEP, ROCKY MOUNTAINSIDE ... he
PASSES a CREEPY PAGAN STATUE - placed as if in WARNING. Ahead
lies a TALL CLIFF, with narrow STEPS set into the WALL,
leading to a single DARK DOOR.
WIDE ON: GANDALF climbs the NARROW STAIRS to the DOORWAY. The
REMAINS of an IRON DOOR hang twisted from the entrance.
CLOSE ON: GANDALF pauses, catching his BREATH ... he FROWNS,
and ENTERS.
INT. HIGH FELLS TOMB - DAY
ANGLE ON: looking up from the BOTTOM of a VERY LONG, STEEP
TUNNEL, carved in the ROCK ... the small figure of GANDALF is
SILHOUETTED at the TOP. He starts to DESCEND the STONE RAMP,
but suddenly his FEET SKID on the FLOOR, sending him skating
down FAST.
WIDE ON: GANDALF slides out of the TUNNEL and very nearly
PLUMMETS over the edge of a DEEP SHAFT. He only just manages
to BALANCE.
GANDALF summons a COOL LIGHT from his STAFF and carefully
PROCEEDS along NARROW STEPS inset into the sides of the SHAFT.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF arrives at a BROKEN TOMB DOOR ... inside is
a STONE SARCOPHAGUS, it’s sides too HIGH for GANDALF to see
inside.
A NOISE! A VERY QUIET scratching ... coming from inside the
SARCOPHAGUS!
GANDALF is immediately ALERT, holding his STAFF defensively,
he quietly approaches the HIGH STONE BOX ... the LID, has been
SMASHED, PIECES lie at odd angles in the TOMB ... GANDALF
leans in further, peering into the DARK RECESSES.
AT THAT MOMENT! A SPARROW suddenly rockets out of the
SARCOPHAGUS, in a BLUR of furiously beating WINGS!
The SPARROW races past GANDALF’S FACE, and he spins around to
FOLLOW it ... he suddenly sees a figure silhouetted in
backlight ... he raises his staff ... his breath catches as
the figure steps forward to reveal it is ...
GANDALF
Oh, it’s you!
38MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
RADAGAST looks as startled as GANDALF ...
RADAGAST
Why am I here, Gandalf?
RADAGAST removes his WIZARD’S HAT ... the SPARROW settles in a
nest in RADAGAST’s HAIR.
GANDALF
Trust me Radagast, I would not have
called you here without good reason
RADAGAST
This is not a nice place to meet.
GANDALF
No ... it is not.
GANDALF sends his light around the tomb, as if searching for
clues.
STRANGE MARKINGS can be seen, carved in shallow relief on the
TOMB WALLS.
RADAGAST
(quiet dread)
These are dark spells, Gandalf ... old
and full of hate. Who’s buried here?
GANDALF turns from the TOMB’s entrance.
GANDALF
If he had a name it has long since been
lost ... he was known only as a servant
of evil - one of a number.
GANDALF looks down into the darkness of the DEEP SHAFT.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF raises his staff above his head ... LIGHT
blazes forth to reveal ... EIGHT MORE gaping black holes
BELOW, where heavy STONE DOORS have been SMASHED OPEN.

One of nine ...

Why now Gandalf? I don’t understand.
GANDALF
The Ringwraiths have been summoned to Dol
Guldur.
39MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
RADAGAST
But it cannot be the Necromancer - a
human sorcerer could not summon such
evil.
GANDALF
Who said he was human?
RADAGAST looks alarmed at the thought.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
The Nine only answer to one Master. We’ve
been blind, Radagast - and in our
blindness, our Enemy has returned. He is
summoning his servants ...
GANDALF spins around, confronting RADAGAST.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
Azog the Defiler - he is no ordinary
hunter, he is a commander of legions ...
The Enemy is preparing for war. It will
begin in the East ...
(sudden realisation)
His mind is set on that Mountain.
GANDALF goes to hurry away ...
RADAGAST
Where are you going?
GANDALF
To rejoin the others -
RADAGAST
Gandalf -
GANDALF
I started this, I cannot forsake them
now. They are in grave danger.
RADADAST
If what you say is true ... the world is
in grave danger. Every day the power in
that fortress will grow stronger.
GANDALF stops, he turns back to the LITTLE WIZARD.
GANDALF
You want me to cast my friends aside?
PUSH IN on GANDALF ... he knows he must make a choice.

Not for long - we’ve lost the current!
DWALIN
And Bombur’s half drowned.
THORIN
Make for the shore!
ANGLE ON: exhausted and soaking wet, the DWARVES and BILBO
struggle to manoeuvre their BARRELS to shore by what ever
means they can ... paddling with their own hands or steering
with broken tree branches ...
ANGLE ON: a bedraggled KILI sits on the SHORELINE, blood
already seeping through the fingers of his HAND which covers
the ORC WOUND on his THIGH.
BOFUR offers KILI a bloodied rag.
KILI
I’m fine - it’s nothing.
BOFUR and FILI exchange worried looks.
ANGLE ON: THORIN calls over to FILI and KILI.
THORIN

FILI

There’s an Orc pack on our tail - we keep
moving.

We’ve no weapons to defend ourselves.
THORIN makes a decision - he turns to the others DWARVES.

(to FILI)
Bind his leg - quickly
(worried to BALIN)
You have two minutes.
ANGLE ON: ORI emptying WATER from his BOOTS ... he looks up to
see a TALL, DARK-HAIRED MAN standing in the clearing, an ARROW
fitted to BOW in his hand ... this is BARD.
ANGLE ON: DWALIN’S hand reaches for a LARGE BRANCH raising it
above his shoulder, readying it to throw ... in one smooth
movement BARD sends an ARROW whizzing from his BOW ... it
splits the BRANCH easily in two leaving DWALIN staring in
disbelief at the TWO SHARDS of WOOD in his hands.
Instinctively KILI’s hand moves towards a SHARP ROCK ... BARD
sends an arrow flying, spinning the ROCK out of KILI’s reach
... sending it scudding along the GROUND.
DWALIN looks up at the STRANGER ... another ARROW is already
fitted to his BOW.
BARD
Do it again, and you’re dead.
ANGLE ON: No-one moves.
SUDDENLY BALIN steps forward. BARD swings his ARROW towards
him.

You are from Lake-town, unless I am
mistaken?

DWALIN keeps a LOOKOUT for any approaching ORCS.
ANGLE ON: BARD rolling the empty barrels onto the ROCKY SHORE-
LINE ready to load on to the BARGE.
BARD
What makes you think I would help you?
BALIN
Those boots have seen better days, as has
your coat. And I’ll wager you have some
hungry mouths to feed -
By the look on BARD’s face, BALIN knows he’s struck a chord.
BALIN (CONT’D)
(kindly)
How many bairns?
BARD
A boy and two girls.
BALIN
And your wife’s a beauty, I’ll wager?
BARD
Aye ... she was.
BALIN’s face falls - a misstep.
BALIN
Ah - I’m sorry I didn’t mean ...
DWALIN
(low aside)
Come on, come on - enough of the
niceties.
BALIN brushes him off - but BARD has caught the inter-change.
He stops ROLLING BARRELS and looks at the DWARVES.

What’s your hurry?
DWALIN
What’s it to you?
BARD
I would know who you are and what you are
doing in these lands.MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13

(trying to smooth things over)
We’re simple merchants from the Blue
Mountains - journeying to see our kin in
the Iron Hills.
BARD
(looking at THORIN)
Simple merchants, you say?
THORIN
We need food, supplies - weapons. Can you
help us?
BARD
I know where these barrels came from.
THORIN
What of it?
BARD
I don’t know what business you had with
the Elves but I do not think it ended
well. No-one enters Lake-town but by
leave of the Master. His wealth comes
from trade with the Woodland Realm. He
will see you in irons before risking the
wrath of King Thranduil.
BALIN
I’ll wager there are ways to enter that
town unseen -
BARD goes to turn away. DWALIN looks to BALIN, urgently.
BARD
Aye, but for that you would need a
smuggler.
BALIN
(urgent)
For which we would pay double.

INT. THRANDUIL’S CHAMBER, WOODLAND REALM, MIRKWOOD - DAY
CLOSE ON: The ELVENKING, THRANDUIL, his face half shadowed in
flickering torchlight.
THRANDUIL glances towards a captive ORC, NARZUG, slumped
before the ELVES. LEGOLAS holds the ORC’s head back, his
dagger is at his throat. TAURIEL stands nearby.
THRANDUIL
Out there in the vast ignorance of the
world it festers and spreads ... A shadow
that grows in the dark. A sleepless
malice as black as the oncoming wall of
night. So it ever was; so will it always
be - in time all foul things come forth.
NARZUG looks at TAURIEL with pure hatred.
LEGOLAS
You were tracking a company of thirteen
Dwarves - why?
NARZUG
(grinning)
Not thirteen, not anymore. The young one,
the black-haired archer ...
CLOSE ON: TAURIEL, a bare flicker in her eyes, tells us she
knows he is speaking of KILI.
NARZUG (ADR PICK-UP) (CONT’D)
(with relish)
... stuck him with a Morgul shaft ... The
poison’s in his blood, he’ll be choking
it on it soon.
NARZUG laughs, lifting his head.
TAURIEL
Answer the question - filth.
NARZUG
(BLACK SPEECH with subtitles)
Shâ hakhtiz khunai-go, Golgi!
I do not answer to dogs, She-Elf!
NARZUG spits at TAURIEL ... in a flash there is a dagger in
her hand.
LEGOLAS
I would not antagonize her.
TAURIEL lunges towards NARZUG, dagger in hand. THRANDUIL
restrains her.
TAURIEL
You like killing things, Orc? You like
death? Then let me give it to you.

THRANDUIL (CONT’D)
I do not care about one dead dwarf.
Answer the question. You have nothing to
fear. Tell us what you know and I will
set you free.
LEGOLAS looks at his father sharply. NARZUG casts sly looks to
LEGOLAS and THRANDUIL, weighing his chances.
LEGOLAS
You had orders to kill them. Why? What is
Thorin Oakenshield to you?
NARZUG laughs.
NARZUG
(scornful)
The dwarf runt will never be King.
LEGOLAS
King? There is no King Under the Mountain
- nor will there ever be. None would dare
enter Erebor whilst the dragon lives.
NARZUG
You know nothing, your world will burn -
LEGOLAS
What are you talking about - speak!
NARZUG laughs gleefully at LEGOLAS’s surprise.
NARZUG
Our time has come again. My Master serves
the One. Do you understand now Elfling
... death is upon you ... the flames of
war are upon you.
CLOSE ON: THRANDUIL his eyes widen in shock ... he, alone in
the room, understand the reference.
In one sudden movement THRANDUIL draws his SWORD and swings it
towards NARZUG, in an almost disinterested way ... LEGOLAS
suddenly finds NARZUG’S severed head swinging from his hand.
He drops it to the floor.
LEGOLAS
Why did you do that? You promised to set
him free.
46MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
THRANDUIL
And I did - I freed his wretched head
from his miserable shoulders.
LEGOLAS
There was more the Orc could tell us -
THRANDUIL
(enigmatic)
There was nothing more he could tell me.
THRANDUIL turns and begins to stride out of the THRONE ROOM.
LEGOLAS
What did the Orc mean - the Flames of
War?
THRANDUIL
It means they intend to unleash a weapon
so great it will destroy all before it. I
want the watch on our borders doubled.
All roads, all rivers ... nothing moves
but I hear of it. No one enters this

EXT. BANKS OF THE FOREST RIVER - DAY
A DARK, DEFORMED FIGURE creeps swiftly along the BANKS of THE
FOREST RIVER ... his snout pressed to the GROUND ... he looks
up suddenly his eyes glinting, as if he has picked up a scent!
ANGLE ON: FIMBUL leads an ORC PACK onto the RIVERBANK where
the DWARVES came ashore in the BARRELS.
FIMBUL looks at a dark stain that has spread on the wood of a
fallen tree ... wiping his finger across the stain, he licks
it.
FIMBUL
(BLACK SPEECH with subtitles)
Tum nash ... Agra-yi.
Dwarf blood ... They were here.
ANGLE ON: BOLG standing still. He sniffs the air.

EXT. LONG LAKE / BARREL BARGE - PRE-DAWN
EARLY MORNING FOG lies heavy upon still, dark waters.
ANGLE ON: the IRON BOW of a BARGE softly breaking a CRUST of
THIN ICE as it advances across a long, LAKE with surprising
speed.
PULL OUT TO REVEAL: THE DWARVES and BILBO sit huddled together
in the front of a BARGE ... the PRE-DAWN LIGHT is pale and
milky. EMPTY ELVISH BARRELS are stacked on the DECK.
BOFUR
Watch out!
SUDDENLY a HUGE, DARK FORM, looms through the DARK FOG towards
them. BILBO and the DWARVES, duck in surprise!
48MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
CLOSE ON: the TALL, DARK-HAIRED BARGEMAN calmly pulls on the
TILLER, navigating the dark waters as if by instinct.
The DWARVES stare as the BARGE passes under an ancient STONE
ARCHWAY, rising out of the WATER. The BARGE lists dangerously
to one side.
THORIN moves towards the BARGEMAN.
THORIN
What are you trying to do? Drown us?
BARD
(calmly)
I was born and bred on these waters,
Master Dwarf - if I wanted to drown you,
I would not do it here.
DWALIN turns to his fellow DWARVES, muttering ...
DWALIN
(low voice)
I’ve had enough of this lippy lakeman. I
say we drop him over the side and be done
wi’ it.
BILBO
Bard.
The DWARVES look at BILBO.
BILBO (CONT’D)
His name is Bard.
BOFUR
How do you know?
BILBO
I asked him.
DWALIN spits to one side, his eyes not leaving BARD.
DWALIN
I don’t care what he calls himself, I
don’t like him.
Some of the other DWARVES murmur agreement. BALIN’s voice cuts
through them.
BALIN
(calmly counting coins)
We do not have to like him. We simply
have to pay him ... come on now lads,
turn out your pockets.
DWALIN
How do we know he won’t betray us?
49MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
THORIN
We don’t.
EXT. LONG LAKE / BARREL BARGE - PRE-DAWN
BALIN clears his throat noisily ... he nudges THORIN.
BALIN
(under his breath)
There’s a wee problem ... we’re ten coins
short.
The DWARVES MUTTER as they hunt in their sodden clothing for
more MONEY.
THORIN
Gloin - come on ... give us what you
have.
GLOIN
(indignant)
Don’t look to me! I’ve been bled dry by
this venture ... and what have I seen for
my investment? Eh? Nought but misery and
grief!
THORIN doesn’t respond ... GLOIN realizes his companions are
STARING SILENTLY towards the NORTHWEST ... he follows their
GAZE.
WIDE ON: far away in the distance, the LONELY MOUNTAIN is
VISIBLE! It’s peak rises above the shreds of a torn cloud, as
the first light of DAWN begin to lighten the sky.
The DWARVES ... have fallen silent, each staring at their
ANCIENT HOMELAND in awe and wonder.
ANGLE ON: GLOIN, as he stuffs a SMALL LEATHER PURSE bulging
with COINS into THORIN’s hands.
GLOIN (CONT’D)
(choked up)
Take it ... take all of it!.
CLOSE ON: BILBO realizes that BARD is staring intently at the
DWARVES interest in the LONELY MOUNTAIN. BILBO attempts to get
the DWARVES attention.
BARD
(tense)
The money, quick - give it to me.
THORIN
We’ll pay you when we get our provisions
and not before.
50MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
BARD
If you value your freedom, you will do as
I say. There are guards ahead.
A loud SHOUT travels across the WATER ...
BILBO and the DWARVES follow BARD’S gaze.
WIDE ON: a HUGE WOODEN TOWN looms out of the THINNING FOG,
revealing dark shapes of crooked BUILDINGS and the GOLDEN GLOW
of TORCHLIGHT.
EXT. LAKE-TOWN - DAWN
WIDE ON: BARD’S BARGE is several HUNDRED YARDS from the
RAMSHACKLE collection of WHARVES, BRIDGES, SPIRES, WATCHTOWERS
which rise out of the WATER. ROW upon ROW of CROOKED THATCHED
HOUSES balance on slumping PILES ... a long WOODEN BRIDGE is
the only connection with the SHORELINE. This is LAKE-TOWN.
LAKE-TOWN is surrounded by a small fleet of early morning
FISHERMAN, pulling nets in from SMALL BOATS ... BARD’S BARGE
slides beside on the FISHING BOATS.
EXT. BARD’S BARGE / LONG LAKE - DAWN
ANGLE ON: BARD is BARTERING with a couple of FISHERMAN in a
HUSHED VOICE ... BILBO and the DWARVES have disappeared from
the DECK. A COUPLE of MASTER’s GUARDS are patrolling nearby.
CLOSE ON: BILBO’S EYE peers out of a HOLE in a BARREL,
watching BARD ...
ANGLE ON: DWALIN is squeezed into his SMALL BARREL.
DWALIN
What’s he doing?
BILBO
He’s talking to someone ... he’s pointing
right at us! Now they’re shaking hands.
THORIN
What?!
DWALIN
He’s selling us out!
ANGLE ON: BARD pointing towards the BARRELS!
DWALIN glances as a SHADOW looms over his BARREL.
ANGLE ON: BARD pours a BASKET of FISH over DWALIN!
QUICK ANGLES: BILBO and the DWARVES are buried in FRESH FISH,
hiding them from VIEW.
51MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
EXT. LAKE-TOWN TOLL-GATE - DAWN
ANGLE ON: BARD, TENSE and WATCHFUL, steers his BARGE towards a
CANAL that leads into the HEART of LAKE-TOWN ... the BARRELS
sit on his DECK, full of FISH. DWARVISH GRUMBLING can be heard
coming from the BARRELS. BARD kicks at one with his foot.
BARD
Quiet - we’re approaching the toll-gate.
A HEAVY IRON GATE blocks the CANAL ENTRANCE, flanked by dank
CUSTOMS BUILDINGS.
A VOICE calls out in the gloom.
PERCY
Halt! Good’s inspection, pull alongside!
Papers, please! Oh, it’s you, Bard.
ANGLE ON: PERCY, the town’s TOLL COLLECTOR, steps out of the
CUSTOM’S BUILDING, holding a LANTERN.
BARD
(nodding)
Morning, Percy ...
BARD hands PERCY a WAYBILL who quickly scans it.
PERCY
Anything to declare?
BARD
Nothing - but that I’m cold and tired and
ready for home.
PERCY
You and me both.
(stamping the paper)
There we are ... all in order -
PERCY smiles, handing back the WAYBILL.
ALFRID
Not so fast!
The WAYBILL is plucked out of PERCY’S hand by ALFRID, an
officious LITTLE MAN - the PRIVATE SECRETARY to the MASTER of
LAKE-TOWN. He is flanked by several GUARDS including a heavy-
set CAPTAIN, called BRAGA and a thuggish looking off-sider,
called MR. SOURY.
ALFRID (CONT’D)
(reading)
Consignment of empty barrels from the
Woodland Realm ...
ALFRID’S eyes flicker across the BARRELS, brimming with FISH.
52MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
ALFRID (CONT’D)
Only ... they’re not empty, are they
Bard?
ALFRID peers into the BARRELS.
CLOSE ON: ALFRID picks up a FISH by it’s tail, revealing
BOMBUR’S WIDE EYES, peering from amongst the EYES of the DEAD
FISH ... ALFRID turns back to BARD, and BOMBUR BLINKS.
ALFRID (CONT’D)
If I recall correctly, you’re licensed as
a bargeman, not a fisherman.
BARD
That’s none of your business.
ALFRID
Wrong - it’s the Master’s business -
which makes it my business.
BARD
Come on, Alfrid - have a heart. People
need to eat.
ALFRID
These fish are illegal!
ALFRID tosses the FISH away, and turns to his GUARDS.
ALFRID (CONT’D)
(ordering)
Empty these barrels over the side.
BRAGA
(ordering his men)
You heard him, in the canal!
ANGLE ON: the GUARDS swarm onto the DECK, and start to push
the HEAVY BARRELS towards the side of the BARGE ... BILBO
looks ALARMED, as his BARREL is manhandled.
BARD remains impassive.
BARD
Folk in this town are struggling. Times
are hard, food is scarce -
ALFRID
That’s not my problem.
BARD
And when the people hear the Master is
dumping fish back in the lake; when the
rioting starts - will it be your problem
then?
53MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
ALFRID hesitates ... BARRELS are about to get pushed into the
WATER ... he SUDDENLY raises his HAND, stopping the GUARDS. He
gestures to BRAGA, and the GUARDS back away from the BARRELS.
ALFRID
Stop!
ALFRID leans close to BARD.
ALFRID (CONT’D)
Ever the people’s champion, eh, Bard?
“Protector of the common folk”. You may
have their favour now, Bargeman, but it
won’t last. The Master has his eye on
you. You would do well to remember - we
know where you live.
CLOSE ON: BARD, his eyes flicker briefly in anger.
BARD
It’s a small town, Alfrid - everyone
knows where everyone lives.
ANGLE ON: the IRON WATER GATE opens, allowing BARD entry into
LAKE-TOWN.
EXT. LAKE-TOWN CANALS - DAY
WIDE ON: BARD steers his BARGE down the NARROW LAKE-TOWN
CANALS ...
ANGLE ON: TWO HUNGRY PUGS scavenge for food along the DOCKS.
INT. MASTER’S BED-CHAMBER, LAKE-TOWN - DAY
WIDE ON: The GREAT HALL ...
ALFRID (O.S.)
All this talk of civil unrest ...
ANGLE ON: ALFRID tosses the contents of a CHAMBER POT out an
open window.
ALFRID (CONT’D)
Someone’s been stirring the pot, Sire.
ANGLE ON: The MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN hobbles out of bed, sitting
down hard on a SETTLE
ALFRID (CONT’D)
Gout playing up, Sire?
MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
It’s the damp - it’s the only possible
explanation. Get me a brandy.
54MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
ALFRID
The mood of the people - it’s turning
ugly.
ANGLE ON: THE MASTER sits at the end of his bed. He’s a BIG-
BELLIED, RED-FACED MAN, dressed in a FLORID DRESSING GOWN.
ANGLE ON: ALFRID pours a large tumbler of BRANDY ...
MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
They’re commoners, Alfrid ... they’ve
always been ugly. It’s not my fault they
live in a place that stinks of fish oil
and tar. Jobs, food, shelter; it’s all
they ever bleat about.
ALFRID
It’s my belief, Sire, they’re being led
on by troublemakers.
ANGLE ON: THE MASTER - his attention has been caught.
INT. MASTER’S HALL, LAKE-TOWN - DAY
ANGLE ON: THE MASTER enters a dark vaulted HALL, lined with
ledgers ... an ornate DESK sits at one end. The HALL’S
pillars, floor and walls are badly warped with damp.
MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Then we must find these troublemakers and
arrest them!
ALFRID
My thoughts exactly, Sire.
MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
All this talk of ‘change’ must be
suppressed. The next thing you know
they’ll be asking questions, forming
committees, launching inquiries ...
ALFRID
Out with the old ... in with the new?
MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
What?
ANGLE ON: ALFRID’s watches the MASTER ...
ALFRID
(slyly)
That’s what they’re saying, Sire ...
there’s even talk of an election.
MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
An election!
CLOSE ON: THE MASTER turns, shocked by the suggestion.
55MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN (CONT’D)
That’s absurd! I won’t stand for it!
ALFRID
I don’t think they’d ask you to stand,
Sire.
EXT. MASTER’S HALL BALCONY, LAKE-TOWN - DAY - REPOSITIONED
ANGLE ON: THE MASTER steps onto a BALCONY with an EXPANSIVE
VIEW of LAKETOWN.
MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Shirkers, ingrates, rouble rousers ...
who would have the nerve to question my
authority? Who would dare -
ANGLE ON: The MASTER’S face hardens ...
MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN (CONT’D)
Bard! You mark my words, that trouble
making bargeman is behind this.
EXT. INDUSTRIAL DOCK - DAY
ANGLE ON: BARD looks around ... his BARGE has arrived in a
QUIET, INDUSTRIAL part of LAKE-TOWN ... the ALLEYS are EMPTY
... a solitary DOCK WORKER secures the MOORING.
ANGLE ON: BARD uses his FOOT to tip BARRELS over ... FISH and
INDIGNANT DWARVES spill onto the DECK.
The DOCK WORKER looks AMAZED, as BILBO and the DWARVES,
extract FISH from all parts of their clothing ... BARD presses
a SILVER COIN into the DOCK WORKER’S palm.
BARD
You didn’t see them. They were never
here. The fish you can have for nothing.
ANGLE ON: BARD leading the DWARVES and BILBO away from the
WHARF.
BARD
(CONT’D)
Follow me.
CLOSE ON: HILDA, a HERB SELLER, watches the DWARVES in
wonderment.

EXT. BARD’S HOUSE - DAY
ANGLE ON: BARD’S two story HOUSE sits on a narrow CANAL in a
rundown part of LAKE-TOWN.
CLOSE ON: a one-eyed BEGGAR is hunched in an ALCOVE ... he
taps his CANE on a wall ... TWO SMALL boys run down an ALLEY
ringing a bell as they pass.
A SHADY looking character in a nearby ALLEY lights his PIPE. .
ANGLE ON: BARD and BAIN emerge out of the ALLEY and hurry to
their door, casting glances over their shoulder.
BARD and BAIN hurry up the STAIRS to their FRONT DOOR
TWO BOATMEN sit in a small boat in the CANAL ... BARD glances
down at them before chucking them an apple.
BARD
Tell the Master - I’m done for the day.
BARD and BAIN disappear inside the HOUSE.
INT. BARD’S HOUSE - DAY
CLOSE ON: BARD closes and BOLTS the DOOR ... SIGRID, 14 and
TILDA, 8, BARD’s TWO DAUGHTERS greet him.
TILDA
Da! Where have you been?
SIGRID
(relieved)
Father! There you are - I was worried.
BARD hugs them, picking TILDA up ... he glances out of the
WINDOW, then turns to BAIN.
BARD
Get them in.
INT. BARD’S BASEMENT - DAY
ANGLE ON: BAIN hurries down STEEP STAIRS, and pushes open a
TOILET DOOR.
INT. BARD’S TOILET - DAY
CLOSE ON: A simple TOILET SEAT, perched directly over the LAKE-
TOWN WATER ... DWALIN’S HEAD suddenly pops up through the HOLE
- he GLARES at BAIN.
57MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
DWALIN
If you speak of this to anyone I’ll rip
your arms off.
ANGLES ON: BAIN helps haul BILBO and the WET DWARVES out of
the LONG-DROP, cursing and dripping.
BAIN
(signalling)
Up there.
INT. BARD’S HOUSE - DAY
ANGLE ON: SIGRID is watching down the STAIRS.
SIGRID
Da - why are there dwarves climbing out
of our toilet?
TILDA
Will they bring us luck?
INT. BARD’S HOUSE - DAY
ANGLE ON: THE DWARVES sitting around a WOODEN TABLE. They have
wrapped themselves in MAN-SIZED CLOAKS, JACKETS and BLANKETS
... DWARF-BOOTS dry in front of a FIRE PLACE ... SIGRID is
passing out MUGS of TEA. TILDA is handing out BLANKETS and
CLOTHES.
BARD
They may not be the best fit, but they’ll
keep you warm.
ANGLE ON: THORIN is staring out the open window.
BILBO follows his gaze ... in the DISTANCE, atop a WATCHTOWER
is the silhouette of a LARGE, MOUNTED CROSSBOW.
THORIN
(low voiced)
A Dwarvish windlance.
BILBO
You look like you’ve seen a ghost.
BALIN
(low voiced aside)
He has. The last time we saw such a
weapon ... a city was on fire.
PUSHING IN on BALIN as he remembers ...
BALIN (CONT’D)

day Smaug destroyed Dale.
58MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13

INSERT FLASHBACK: FIRE rains down upon DALE ... people run
through the STREETS screaming ...
BALIN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Girion, the Lord of the City, rallied his
bowman to fire upon the beast. But
dragon’s hide are tough - tougher than
the Strongest armour. Only a black arrow
fired from a windlance could have pierced
the dragon’s hide... and few of those
arrows were ever made.
INSERT FLASHBACK: GIRION, LORD OF DALE, stands atop the
highest TOWER. He is manning a LARGE CROSS BOW, desperately
aiming at the HUGE BEAST which soars overhead.
BALIN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Their store was running low when Girion
made his last stand. Alas, to no avail.
ANGLE ON: THORIN stares out the WINDOW towards the CROSSBOW.
THORIN
Had the aim of Men been true that day,
much would have been different.
BARD
(suspicious)
You speak as if you were there?
THORIN turns and faces BARD, who has stepped up behind him.
THORIN
All Dwarves know the tale.
BAIN
Then you would know that Girion hit the
dragon - he loosened a scale under the
left wing. One more shot and he would
have killed the beast.
DWALIN
That’s a fairy story, lad, nothing more.
THORIN turns to BARD.
THORIN
You took our money - where are the
weapons?
BARD
Wait here.
As BARD heads downstairs ...

BARD steps onto a small landing beneath his house. A ROW BOAT
is docked alongside.MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13

Peering around cautiously, BARD retrieves a LARGE OIL-SKIN
wrapped BUNDLE from beneath the WATER and carries them inside.
CUT TO:
THORIN, BALIN, KILI and FILI huddle together in conversation.
THORIN
Tomorrow begins the last days of autumn.
BALIN
Durin’s Day falls the morn after next. We
must reach the mountain before then.
KILI
And if we do not? If we fail to find the
hidden door before that time ...?
FILI
Then this quest has been for nothing.
ANGLE ON: the DWARVES stop talking as BARD enters and dumps
the large OIL-SKIN BUNDLE on the TABLE.
CLOSE ON: the OIL-SKIN is pulled away, revealing an array of
home-made WEAPONS, fashioned from FISHING EQUIPMENT, TOOLS and
roughly HEWN IRON.
The DWARVES look on in DISMAY ... THORIN picks up a short
STAFF with a rusty HOOK bound with twine.
THORIN
What is this?
BARD
A pike-hook - made from an old harpoon.
It can tear the legs from under a foe -
if handled right.
KILI
And this?
BARD
A crowbill we call it; fashioned from a
smithy’s hammer. Heavy in hand, I grant -
but well balanced for all that.
KILI winces as he lays the weapon back down, shifting his
weight from his bad leg.
BARD (CONT’D)
In defence of your life, these will serve
you better than none.
GLOIN
We paid you for weapons - iron-forged
swords and axes ...MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
BOFUR
It’s a joke!
BARD
You won’t find better outside the city
armoury; all iron-forged weapons are held
there under lock and key.
THORIN exchanges a quick glance with DWALIN.
BALIN
Thorin!
CLOSE ON: BARD receiving THORIN’s name.
BALIN (CONT’D)
Why not take what’s on offer and go.
I’ve made do with less, Thorin, and so
have you. I say we leave now.
BARD
You’re not going anywhere.
THORIN and the others look sharply at BARD.
DWALIN
What did you say?
BARD
There’s spies watching this house - and
probably every dock and wharf in town.
You must wait for nightfall.
ANGLE ON: KILI sits down, wincing ... he holds his leg, in
obvious pain.
EXT. BALCONY, BARD’S HOUSE - DAY
ANGLE ON: BARD standing on the BALCONY ...
BARD

EXT. RIVERBANK, FOREST RIVER - DAY - REPOSITIONED
ANGLE ON: TAURIEL races over RIVER BOULDERS, the remains of a
SLAUGHTERED DEER litter the ground. It is obvious it has been
ripped apart and eaten raw.
TAURIEL pulls the ORC ARROW from out of the flank of the
beast.
Following a trail of ORC TRACKS, she climbs stealthily up a
rock face.
WIDE ON: TAURIEL arrives on a HILL overlooking the LONG LAKE
... smoke rises from the chimneys of LAKE-TOWN.
A SUDDEN SOUND behind her ... TAURIEL FREEZES!
SPINNING AROUND she finds herself looking up at LEGOLAS, bow
in hand, arrow aimed directly at her ...
TAURIEL

LEGOLAS
(ELVISH: with subtitles)
Ci orch im, dangen le.
If I was an Orc, you would be dead.
LEGOLAS, lowers his BOW ...
LEGOLAS (CONT’D)
Tauriel, you cannot hunt thirty Orcs on
your own.
TAURIEL
But I am not on my own.
LEGOLAS
You knew I would come.
LEGOLAS moves closer to her.
LEGOLAS (CONT’D)
The King is angry, Tauriel. For six
hundred years my father has protected
you, favoured you ... you defied his
orders, you have betrayed his trust.
ANGLE ON: TAURIEL knows LEGOLAS is speaking the truth, she
knows she owes much to THRANDUIL.
LEGOLAS (CONT’D)
(ELVISH with subtitles)

Come back with me ... he will forgive
you.

TAURIEL turns and looks down at the cold waters of the LONG
LAKE ... she speaks quietly.
TAURIEL
(ELVISH: with subtitles)
Ú-ohenathon ... ci dadwenithon, ú-
ohenathon im.
But I will not ... If I go back, I will
not forgive myself.
LEGOLAS looks taken aback.
TAURIEL (CONT’D)
The King has never let Orc filth roam our
lands, yet he would let this Orc-pack
cross our borders and kill our prisoners.
LEGOLAS
It is not our fight.
TAURIEL
It is our fight. It will not end here.
With every victory this evil will grow.
If your Father has his way, we will do
nothing ... we will hide within our
walls. We will live our lives away from
the light and let the darkness descend.
TAURIEL looks LEGOLAS in the eye.
TAURIEL (CONT’D)
Are we not part of this world? Tell me,
mellon ... when did we let Evil become
stronger than us?
CLOSE ON: LEGOLAS ... he has no answer.

‘Allo Bard. What you after?
BARD
There was a tapestry - an old one.
Where’s it gone?

Can it really be true, has the Lord of
Silver Fountains returned?
BARD looks up in dawning realisation.
On the SOUNDTRACK: BARD recalls an ancient rhyme:
BARD (V.O.)

The King of carven stone
The King beneath the Mountain,
Shall come into his own.

The last rays of the setting sun ripple across the waters
towards the LAKE-TOWN like a shining, path wrought from gold.

ANGLE ON: SIGRID looks up suddenly as the front door bursts
open!
BARD slams the door behind him, scanning the room quickly.
There is no sign of the DWARVES beyond half eaten plates of

ANGLE ON: THORIN, KILI and BILBO are selecting WEAPONS from
RACKS - SWORDS, AXES, MACES ...
THORIN
Just take what we need and go!
THORIN is loading WEAPONS into KILI arms ... KILI staggers
under the weight, his LEG weakening fast.
THORIN (CONT’D)
Are you right?
KILI
I can manage. Let’s just get out of here.
KILI starts to descend the STAIRS ...
SUDDENLY KILI’S leg GIVES WAY, and he falls down, sending
WEAPONS clattering into the GUARDROOM below!
THORIN, DWALIN, NORI and FILI freeze in HORROR.
SUDDENLY armed GUARDS come flooding out of a narrow corridor,
into the ARMOURY ... the DWARVES brandish their WEAPONS, and
within moments, they all have SPEAR POINTS and SWORD TIPS held
at each other’s throats, like a Mexican stand-off ... the
DWARVES show no sign of giving in.
THORIN glances down the STAIRS ...
ANGLE ON: looking down on BRAGA, his foot on KILI, his SWORD
raised above KILI’S neck.
CLOSE ON: THORIN, his face set, a fierce look in his eye.
EXT. CIVIC SQUARE, LAKE-TOWN - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: BRAGA and a cohort of GUARDS shove the DWARVES and
BILBO towards the FOOT of the steps of the MASTER’S HALL. From
all directions, excited TOWNS-FOLK are hurrying into the
SQUARE, a myriad of torches light up the night
CLOSE ON: ALFRID’s head peers out from the DOOR overlooking
the SQUARE ... without a word he withdraws inside, closing the
DOOR.
WITHIN MOMENTS ... the DOUBLE DOORS swing open and THE MASTER
strides out.
MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
What is the meaning of this?
BRAGA
We caught them stealing weapons, Sire.
66MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Enemies of the State, eh?
A GASP goes up from the more nervous members of the CROWD.
ALFRID
A desperate bunch of mercenaries if ever
was, Sire.
DWALIN
Hold your tongue!
ANGLE ON: DWALIN steps forward, enraged.
DWALIN (CONT’D)
You do not know to whom you speak. This
is no common criminal. This is Thorin,
son of Thrain, son of Thror!
PUSHING IN ON: THORIN, he raises his head, stepping forward.
THORIN
We are the Dwarves of Erebor; we have
come to reclaim our homeland.
An excited whisper runs through the CROWD. “So it is true -
the Dwarves of Erebor have returned!” “It is the Prophecy of
old ...”
THORIN looks at the MASTER, before turning to the TOWNSFOLK
that surround them.
THORIN (CONT’D)
I remember this town in the great days of
old - fleets of boats lay at harbour -
filled with silks and fine gems. This was
no forgotten out post, no forsaken town
on a lake. This was the centre of all
trade in the North!
An excited murmur sweeps across the CROWD.
THORIN (CONT’D)
I would see those days return - I would
re-light the great forges of the Dwarves,
and send riches and wealth flowing once
more from the Halls of Erebor.
An even greater CHEER rises from the CROWD; THORIN’s words
resonated around the SQUARE.
BARD
Death!
ANGLE ON: BARD as he pushes his way through the CROWD -
stopping in front of THORIN.
67MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
BARD (CONT’D)
That is what you will bring upon us!
Dragon-fire and ruin!
(BARD hold’s THORIN’s gaze)
If you waken that beast, you will destroy
us all!
THORIN
You can listen to this naysayer ... but I
promise you this - if we succeed all will
share in the wealth of the Mountain - you
will have enough gold to rebuild Esgaroth
ten times over!
BARD turns to the CROWD - appealing to those who have always
stood by him and listened to him.
BARD
All of you, listen to me - you must
listen! Have you forgotten what happened
to Dale? Have you forgotten those who
died in the firestorm ... and for what
purpose? The blind ambition of a Mountain-
king so riven by greed he could not see
beyond his own desire?
THE DWARVES protest loudly. The CROWD jeer back, once more
siding with BARD.
MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Now, now ... we must not, any of us, be
too quick to lay blame ... Let us not
forget it was Girion, Lord of Dale, your
ancestor who failed to kill the beast.
THORIN and BALIN slowly turn to BARD, amazed.
ALFRID
It is true, Sire, we all know the story.
Arrow after arrow he shot, each one
missing it’s mark.
BARD turns on THORIN.
BARD
You have no right, no right to enter that
Mountain -
THORIN
I have the only right!
(turning his back on BARD)
I speak to the Master of the Men of the
Lake. Will you see the Prophecy
fulfilled? Will you share in the great
wealth of our people? What say you?
SILENCE ... THORIN’s eyes hold those of THE MASTER who steps
forward to the railing of the BALCONY.
68MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
THE MASTER
I say unto you -
The CROWD seems to hold it’s breath. SUDDENLY, the MASTER
throws his arms open wide in a grand gesture.
THE MASTER (CONT’D)
Welcome! Welcome! Thrice welcome! King
Under the Mountain!!!
The MASTER bows low to THORIN, inviting him to enter the GREAT
HALL, as a great CHEER explodes from the CROWD!
EXT. LAKE-TOWN WHARF - MORNING
ANGLE ON: BILBO and the DWARVES, dressed in absurd looking
finery bestowed upon them by the MASTER, file onto a BARGE,
loaded with SUPPLIES.
WIDE ON: A CROWD of onlookers and well-wishers lines a NARROW
CANAL to witness the DEPARTURE of the DWARVES
BILBO (O.S.)
You do know we’re one short - where’s
Bofur?
ANGLE ON: THORIN and the DWARVES pushing through the crowds.
THORIN
If he’s not here, we leave him behind.
BALIN
We’ll have to if we’re to find the door
before nightfall. We can risk no more
delays.
ANGLE ON: THORIN pauses at the FOOT of the GANGPLANK, as BILBO
and the DWARVES file past him. He puts an arm on KILI’S
shoulder, stopping him.
THORIN
Not you. We must travel at speed, you
will slow us down.
KILI
(incredulous)
What are you talking about? I’m coming
with you.
(taking in THORIN’s expression)
I’m going to be there when that door is
opened - when we first look upon the
halls of our fathers - Thorin!
THORIN
Kili ... stay here, rest. Join us when
your healed.
69MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
KILI backs away ... OIN has been listening in with his EAR
TRUMPET ... he walks off the BARGE, past THORIN.
OIN
I’ll stay with the lad. My duty lies with
the wounded.
THORIN nods to OIN, turns to find that FILI confronting him.
FILI
Uncle - we grew up on tales of the
Mountain, tales you told us. You cannot
take that away from him. I will carry him
if I must -
THORIN
(low voice)
One day you will be King and you will
understand ... I cannot risk the fate of
this Quest for the sake of one Dwarf -
not even my own kin.
(FILI goes to disembark)
Fili! Don’t be a fool! You belong with
the Company -
FILI
I belong with my brother.
A MOTLEY BAND of MUSICIANS strikes up a SUDDEN FANFARE!
ANGLE ON: THE MASTER and ALFRID pompously making their way
through the CROWD.
INT. MASTER’S HALL, LAKE-TOWN - DAY
The SOUND of distant cheering ECHOES in the EMPTY MASTER’S
HALL.
CLOSE ON: BOFUR sits up, hat askew ... banging his head on the
underside of the MASTER’S DESK ... several tankards and EMPTY
BRANDY bottles lie beside him.
BOFUR
By my beard, is that the time?
EXT. LAKE-TOWN WHARF - DAY
A RAGGED FANFARE SOUNDS ... a row of TRUMPETERS look starkly
out of place amidst the poor surroundings.
ANGLE ON: THE MASTER, flanked by ALFRID, stands on the a
MAKESHIFT PODIUM.
MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN
Go now with our goodwill and good wishes
... And may your return bring good
fortune to all!
70MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
71
A rousing cheer goes up as the BARGE slides out into the ICY
WATERS of the LONG LAKE.
EXT. LAKE-TOWN WHARVES - DAY
ANGLE ON: BOFUR rushes through the CROWD ... skidding to a
stop beside FILI, KILI and OIN.
BOFUR
Did you miss the boat as well?
FILI notices KILI swaying.
FILI
Kili!
KILI slumps to the ground. Sweat beads his forehead, his face
is pale, his breathing shallow.
OIN pulls aside the make-shift BANDAGE on KILI’s leg ... the
whole leg has gone BLACK.
OIN
(under his breath)
Durin save us!
INT. BARD’S HOUSE - DAY
ANGLE ON: BARD opens the door to find BOFUR standing there.
BARD
No - I am done with Dwarves. Go away.
BOFUR scrambles forward, managing to get his foot in the
doorway.
BOFUR
No-one will help us, please - Kili is
sick, he’s very sick.
CUT TO:
EXT. DWARVES BARGE, LONG LAKE - DAY
ANGLE ON: THORIN stands at the PROW, of the BARGE, his eyes
fixed firmly on the solitary peak rising at the far end of the
LAKE.
EXT. VALLEY OF DALE, LONELY MOUNTAIN - DAY
WIDE ON: THORIN leads the SMALL COMPANY into the FOOTHILLS
above LAKE-TOWN, which lies FAR BELOW on the LAKE.MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
NEW VEGETATION has attempted to GROW amongst BLACKENED RUINED
FORESTS, but the TREES are sickly, as if the earth is
POISONED.
ANGLE ON: THORIN as he crests the SLOPE ...
CLOSE ON: BILBO looks up ... a BLEAK SIGHT greets his gaze.
WIDE ON: In the shadow of the LONELY MOUNTAIN we see the
smashed RUINS of ANCIENT HOUSES, TOWERS, BRIDGES and ROADS ...
BLACKENED TREE STUMPS dot the LANDSCAPE ... a FUME of THICK
VAPOUR spills from a dark, cavernous opening at the base of
the SOUTHERN SLOPE ...
BILBO
What is this place?
BALIN
(sadly)
Once it was the city of Dale, now it is a
ruin ... The desolation of a dragon.
CLOSE ON: THORIN, his eyes have travelled upward toward the
pale, watery light of a NOON DAY SUN.
THORIN
The sun will soon reach midday - we must
find the hidden door in to the Mountain
before it sets. This way!
BILBO
Wait - is this the Overlook. Gandalf told
us to meet him here!
THORIN
Do you see him?
BILBO has no answer. THORIN takes the MAP from BILBO.
THORIN (CONT’D)
We have no time to wait upon the Wizard -
we are on our own. Come!
CLOSE ON: BILBO perturbed by THORIN’s dismissal of GANDALF.
EXT. DOL GULDUR - DAY
WIDE ANGLE: ... RADAGAST’S SLEIGH winds its way towards the
HULKING RUINS of DOL GULDUR perched still and ominous in the
MIRKWOOD GLOOM.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF and RADAGAST as they survey the FORTRESS
from a HIDDEN vantage point amidst a THICKET of BLACKENED
THORNS.
GANDALF
Dol Guldur - the Hill of Sorcery.
72MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
RADAGAST
It looks completely abandoned.
GANDALF
As it is meant to ... a spell of
concealment lies over this place.
A SMALL SMILE creeps over his face.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
Which means our Enemy is not yet ready to
reveal himself, he has not regained his
full strength.
(urgent to RADAGAST)
Radagast - I need you to carry a message
to the Lady Galadriel, tell her we must
force his hand.
RADAGAST
What do you mean - ?
WIDE ON: RADAGAST and GANDALF conferring quickly ...
GANDALF
I’m going in alone. On no account come
after me.
RADAGAST nods ... and starts to WALK AWAY.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
Do I have your word?
RADAGAST
Yes, yes, yes ...
CLOSE ON: RADAGAST turns, a look of worry and fear on his
face.
RADAGAST (CONT’D)
Wait, Gandalf ... what if it’s a trap?
GANDALF
Turn around and do not come back. It’s
undoubtedly a trap.
GANDALF makes his way down from their vantage point ... he
unsheathes GLAMDRING ... moving along the crumbling causeway
towards the FRONT GATE ... when he DISAPPEARS from VIEW.
INT. DOL GULDUR COURTYARD - DAWN
ANGLE ON: GANDALF keeps close to the WALL, surveying the
surroundings ... nothing moves, a heavy SILENCE fills the air.
WIDE ON: GANDALF raises his staff, saying an ELVISH SPELL in a
loud voice.
73MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
GANDALF
(QUENYAN without subtitles)
Ké ná ulko sís nurtaina - I ettuluvas
kaninye; Kanin i sá tanuvakse
Whatever evil is hidden here - I command
it come forth; I command it reveal
itself.
GANDALF slams the staff down, releasing a powerful pulse of
WHITE LIGHT, which travels across the fortress like a shock
wave.
NOTHING. No sound, no movement.
GANDALF continues forward into the RUINS, the SPELL cutting
through the SILENCE.
INT. DOL GULDUR, LOWER LEVELS - NIGHT
WIDE ON: a darkened, ill-lit courtyard ... WARG RIDERS
surround the towering FIGURE of AZOG.
ANGLE ON: The GIANT ORC looks up ...
AZOG
(BLACK SPEECH with subtitles)
Zidgu ...
The Wizard ...
AN ORC UNDERLING creeps forward, frightened.
ORC UNDERLING
(BLACK SPEECH with subtitles)
Obtoragish gulum-nu... gimyashim.
He is lifting the spell ... he will find
us.
CLOSE ON: AZOG, smiling grimly ...
AZOG
(BLACK SPEECH with subtitles)
Hurnash.
Yes.
EXT. LONG VALLEY, LONELY MOUNTAIN - DAY
WIDE ON: The DWARVES and BILBO are spread out along the SIDE
of the MOUNTAIN.
DWALIN and GLOIN appear from behind a RIDGE LINE.
THORIN
(calling)
Anything?
74MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
DWALIN
Nothing.
ANGLE ON: THORIN studies the MAP ...
THORIN
(desperate)
There must be a way - if this Map is
true, the hidden door lies directly above
us.
BILBO rounds the CORNER of a LARGE ROCK OUTCROP ... he finds
himself staring at the base of a huge DWARVEN STATUTE that
rises high into the CLIFFS above.
BILBO
Up here!
ANGLE ON: The DWARVES cluster around ... BILBO gestures
towards the STATUE.
CLOSE ON: ... carved into the STONE ARMOUR and CLOTH are worn
and crumbling STAIRS that wend their way steeply UPWARDS
around the contours of the STATUE.
THORIN claps BILBO on the back, with real gratitude.
THORIN
You have keen eyes, Master Baggins.
EXT. HIDDEN STAIRS, LONELY MOUNTAIN - DUSK
WIDE ON: BILBO leads THORIN, DWALIN, GLOIN, BALIN, BIFUR,
BOMBUR, NORI, DORI and ORI up the ANCIENT CRUMBLING STAIRWAY.
EXT. HIDDEN BAY, LONELY MOUNTAIN - DUSK
ANGLE ON: BILBO arrives at the top of the STATUE and steps
onto a narrow STEEP WALLED LEDGE.
ONE by ONE BILBO is joined by the DWARVES ... they find him
STARING at the SMOOTH SURFACE of the ROCK WALL at the end of
the SMALL COVE.
THORIN runs his hand over the surface of the ROCK. The
faintest outline can be seen.
THORIN
(softly)
This is it - the hidden door.
ANGLE ON: THORIN pulls the key from his shirt, ripping it from
it’s chain, he holds it up triumphantly!
THORIN (CONT’D)
Let all those who doubted us - rue this
day!
75MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
The OTHERS CHEER.
DWALIN
Right then ... we have a key, which means
somewhere ... there is a keyhole.
EXT. HIDDEN BAY, LONELY MOUNTAIN - DUSK
WIDE ANGLE: The SUN is beginning to set.
DWALIN cannot find the keyhole.
THORIN
The last light of Durin’s Day will shine
upon the keyhole.
THORIN turns to NORI.
THORIN (CONT’D)
Nori!
ANGLE ON: NORI is already pulling an assortment of specialist
equipment from his BACK-PACK. He steps up to the WALL,
examining the smooth stone surface with an expert eye ...
DWALIN joins him, running his hands over the stone.
NORI places a LISTENING DEVICE on to the rock ... he begins to
tap the rock with a SMALL CHISEL, listening for a hollow
sound.
THORIN watches NORI working, BALIN is staring at the ROCK WALL
dubiously.
THORIN (CONT’D)
We’re loosing the light - come on!
CLOSE ON: DWALIN turns towards THORIN ... a look of concern on
his face. He turns and RAMS at the WALL searching & bashing.
NORI
Be quiet. I can’t hear when you’re
thumping!
DWALIN
I can’t find it. It’s not there.
ANGLE ON: THORIN turns to the OTHER DWARVES ...
THORIN
(rising panic)
Break it down!
BILBO jumps in fright as the DWARVES collectively STRIKE
against THE HARD STONE WALL with PICKS and CHISELS.
76MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
THORIN (CONT’D)
Come on!
(under his breath)
It has to break!
CRACCKK! The WOODEN SHAFTS of their PICKS SPLINTER and the
STEEL HEADS of their HAMMERS SHATTER.
CLOSE ON: THORIN’S face DARKENS ... there is not even a DENT
in the SMOOTH ROCK-FACE.
BALIN
It’s no good ... the door is sealed. It
cannae be opened by force. There is a
powerful magic on it.
THORIN looks around DESPERATELY ... the SUN is SINKING behind
a BAND of LOW THICK CLOUD, sitting just above the horizon.
THORIN pulls out the MAP poking an ANGRY FINGER at the RUNES.
THORIN
“The last light of Durin’s Day will shine
upon the keyhole” ... that’s what it
says!
THORIN points at the SETTING SUN.
THORIN (CONT’D)
What did we miss? What did we miss,
Balin?
BALIN shakes his head, he has no answer.
HOPE begins to drain from THORIN’S FACE as the LIGHT seeps
from the SKY, cloaking the mountain in DUSK.
BALIN puts a comforting HAND on THORIN’S SHOULDER.
BALIN
We have lost the light - there’s no more
to be done. We had but one chance ...
it’s over. Come on lads ... come away.
THORIN opens his HAND to reveal THE KEY lying in his PALM ...
slowly he turns his PALM and the KEY falls to the ground.
WIDE ON: Slowly, the COMPANY of DWARVES turn away and begin to
make their way back down the HIDDEN PATH.
CLOSE ON: BILBO ... not believing that this can be the end of
their QUEST.
BILBO
Wait a minute - where’re they going? You
can’t give up now! Thorin? You can’t give
up now ...
ANGLE ON: THORIN’S thrusts the MAP at BILBO as he leaves.
77MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
The others ignore him, BILBO turns back, staring at the SMOOTH
ROCK WALL.
WIDE ON: BILBO standing in front of the ROCK FACE, a cold wind
rises, blowing around him.
ANGLE ON: BILBO looks towards the WEST ... RISING in the SKY
is the slender SICKLE of a SILVERY MOON which sends a soft
beam of light across the face of the ROCK WALL.
BILBO (CONT’D)
(muttering to himself)
Stand by the grey stone when the thrush
knocks and the setting sun with the last
light of Durin’s Day will shine ...
(repeating)
... the last light ... the last light ...
A sound begins to seep into the small HOBBIT’S consciousness.
KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK ... BILBO turns to see the THRUSH who has
caught a large SNAIL in its beak knocking its shell against
the GREY ROCK.
ANGLE ON: the MOONLIGHT gains in STRENGTH.
CLOSE ON: FAINT MOON RUNES start to SHIMMER on the ROCK FACE
... BILBO catches his breath.
ANGLE ON: a narrow RED RAY of DYING SUNLIGHT escapes like a
finger through a rent in the CLOUD. It races through a valley
in the SKYLINE, past BILBO and falls on the SMOOTH ROCK FACE.
CRACK!
CLOSE ON: A FLAKE OF ROCK splits and falls from the WALL,
leaving a HOLE in the midst of the MOON RUNE markings. For a
BRIEF MOMENT the LIGHT from both the MOON and the SUN plays on
the ROCK.
CLOSE ON: BILBO realizes what is happening!
BILBO (CONT’D)
(softly)
The last light ... The last light!!!
(calling)
Come back! It’s the light of the moon ...
the last moon of autumn.
(to himself)
The key! Where is the key?
ANGLE ON: BILBO SCRAMBLES around desperately in the DARK
trying to find the KEY on the dusty ledge.
CLOSE ON: a FURRY HOBBIT FOOT unwittingly knocks the KEY,
sending it flying towards the EDGE of the BAY ...
SUDDENLY a heavy, DWARVEN BOOT stops the KEY from sliding over
the EDGE. THORIN bends down and picks it up.
78MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
79
ANGLE ON: THORIN inserts the KEY into the KEYHOLE ... it
TURNS ... CLICK!
ANGLE ON: The DWARVES all stare at the moonlit DOOR. The RUNES
which glow in the SILVERY LIGHT are beginning to FADE.
An OLD MECHANISM releases it’s hold, and the ROCK FACE
shudders slightly. THORIN pushes against the rock.
Long straight CRACKS appear and WIDEN, as the DOOR slowly
opens INWARDS without a SOUND.
THORIN
(softly)
Erebor ...
DARKNESS seems to flow out like a vapour, leaving the COMPANY
staring into a BLACK NOTHINGNESS leading down into the DEPTHS
of the MOUNTAIN.
ANGLE ON: THORIN walks forward into the DARKNESS as if SPELLBOUND.
BALIN
Thorin ...
THORIN is staring at the smooth STONE WALLS of the TUNNEL.
THORIN
I know these walls ... these halls ...
this stone. Do you remember it, Balin?
Chambers filled with golden light.
BALIN
I remember ...
ANGLE ON: AN IMAGE etched in STONE above the inside of THE
DOOR, is a beautifully CARVED bas-relief.
GLOIN reads the ANCIENT RUNES beneath the CARVING.
GLOIN (ADR PICK-UP)
(reading)
Herein lies the Seventh Kingdom of
Durin’s folk ... may the Heart of the
Mountain unite all Dwarves in defence of
this Home.
CLOSE ON: BILBO is staring at the ornate CARVING which depicts
a THRONE ... above which a SMALL, OVAL SHAPED GEM is
SUSPENDED. Lines of LIGHT seem to radiate from the JEWEL in
all directions.
BALIN
(reverently)
The throne of the King ...
BILBO
What’s that above it?MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
BALIN
The Arkenstone.
BILBO
The Arkenstone? Hmmm ...
(beat)
And what’s that?
BILBO looks up to see that all the DWARVES are staring at him.
THORIN
That, Master Burglar, is why you are
here.
INT. BARD’S HOUSE - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: KILI’s face covered in sweat. FILI turns to OIN.
FILI
Can you not do something?
OIN
I need herbs. Something to bring his
fever down.
BARD
I have Nightshade, Feverfew ...
OIN
They are no use to me. Do you have any
Kingsfoil?
BARD
No, it’s a weed. We feed it to the pigs.
BOFUR
Pigs? Weed? Right ... don’t move!
ANGLE ON: BOFUR rushes out the door.
INT. DWARF TUNNEL, LONELY MOUNTAIN - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: BILBO and BALIN creep down the NARROW TUNNEL. Behind
them, the DOORWAY frames the black silhouette of waiting
DWARVES.
BILBO
You want me to find a jewel?
BALIN
A large, white jewel ... yes.
BILBO
That’s it? Only I imagine there’s quite a
few of them down there ...
80MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
BALIN
There is only one Arkenstone, you will
know it, when you see it.
BILBO gazes down the tunnel ... hesitating.
BILBO
Right.
BALIN
(worried)
In truth, lad, I do not know what you
will find down there ...
BILBO looks at him, they both know of what BALIN speaks.
BALIN (CONT’D)
You needn’t go if you don’t want to.
There’s no dishonour in turning back.
BILBO
No .. Balin ... I promised I would do
this and I think I must try.
BILBO tightens his belt and adjusts the small sword at his
side and prepares to head down the TUNNEL.
BALIN
(admiringly)
It never ceases to amaze me.
BILBO
What’s that?
BALIN
The courage of Hobbits.
(clapping BILBO on the back)
Go now with as much luck as you can
muster.
BILBO begins to head down the TUNNEL when BALIN calls him
back.
BALIN (CONT’D)
Oh and Bilbo ... if there is in fact a
live dragon down there ... don’t waken
it.
BILBO looks at BALIN, confused, but BALIN has turned away,
disappearing back up the TUNNEL.
EXT. DOL GULDUR COURTYARD - DAY
GANDALF moves through an abandoned COURTYARD incanting a spell
... he sweeps his staff over the empty darkness ...
GANDALF slams down his staff ... through the pulse of WHITE
LIGHT bursts AZOG, throwing GANDALF to the ground.
81MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13

Nakhig lo shulun, Sharrukû
You have come too late, Wizard!
AZOG (CONT’D)
(BLACK SPEECH with subtitles)
Gorz nash!
It is done!
AZOG and his ORC FORCES prepare to attack.
GANDALF aims his STAFF towards them, a POWERFUL FORCE halts
them in their tracks.
GANDALF
Where is your Master? Where is he?
AZOG
(BLACK SPEECH with subtitles)
Ommig shâ zog. Undaguz nag.
He is everywhere. We are legion.
GANDALF’s eyes fall upon the legions of ORC ARMIES gathered
within the depths of DOL GULDUR.
AZOG (CONT’D)
(BLACK SPEECH with subtitles)
Murganim
It is over.
GANDALF fires a PULSE of BRIGHT LIGHT towards AZOG ... in that
MOMENT, the WIZARD is GONE!
ANGLE ON: AZOG spins around dazed and sees GANDALF escaping...
AZOG (CONT’D)
(BLACK SPEECH with subtitles)
Gurid Dum!
Run him down!
The ORC pack moves forward relentlessly ...
GANDALF breaks a STONE BRIDGE causing the pursuing ORC’s to
plummet into the abyss.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF reacts as the COURTYARD DARKENS ... the SKY
ABOVE broils, and BLACK CLOUDS gather.
AT THAT MOMENT! ... DOL GULDUR starts VIBRATING ...
NECROMANCER
(BLACK SPEECH with subtitles)
Ziduk ya nan ... uzu nak zidan
There is no light Wizard ... that can
defeat darkness.
82MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
CLOSE ON: GANDALF raises his STAFF against the POWERFUL FORCE,
a SHIELD of LIGHT SURROUNDING him.
LIGHT and DARKNESS BATTLE ...
ANGLE ON: GANDALF’s STAFF slowly disintegrates in his hand as
a HUGE FLAMING EYE takes shape in front of him. The DARKNESS
lifts GANDALF and smashes him to the GROUND.
The WIZARD is slammed against the WALL in pain ... he stares
into the FLAMING MASS, as the DARK PUPIL form into the SHAPE
of a FIGURE ...
GANDALF
(under his breath)
Sauron!
INT. SMAUG’S LAIR, LONELY MOUNTAIN - DUSK
ANGLE ON: BILBO pauses to control his BREATHING, which is
getting LOUD. SWEAT runs down his FACE - it’s clearly getting
HOT down there.
ANGLE ON: a FAINT GLOW emanates from the CAVERNS ahead - not
from fire, but a DULL GOLD COLOUR.
MOONLIGHT is seeping into the CAVERNS, but not enough to show
their true SIZE ... the SPACES open up and fade into DARKNESS.
BILBO marvels at the VAST CAVERN DWARF-HALLS rising above his
head.
BILBO’s voice echoes faintly through the VAST CAVERN.
BILBO
(relieved whisper)
Not at home ... good, good, good.
CLOSE ON: BILBO’S FEET step onto GOLD COINS, and he attempts
to avoid them ... but very soon that is IMPOSSIBLE. The FLOOR
is covered in HILLS of GOLD ... not just COINS, but CUPS,
TRINKETS, and TREASURE of all KINDS.
WIDE ON: The TINY FIGURE of BILBO quietly scrambles across a
SEA of GOLD. BILBO moves SLOWLY, barely allowing his WEIGHT to
move the GOLD MOUNTAIN.
BILBO (CONT’D)
(muttering to himself)
The Arkenstone ... the Arkenstone ...
(reciting under his breath)
A large, white jewel ... very helpful!
ANGLE ON: BILBO reaching out he pulls out a SMALL GOLD CUP
unwittingly setting off a SMALL LANDSLIDE of GOLDEN COINS.
CLOSE ON: the last few PIECES OF GOLD fall away, to reveal:
83MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
THE BULBOUS LIDDED EYE of a HUGE SLEEPING DRAGON! BILBO
FREEZES IN HORROR!
SMAUG is lying ASLEEP, burrowed under a mountain of GOLD ... A
VAPOUR of STEAM gently RISES through a mound of SHIMMERING
TREASURE. BILBO can now hear the SOFT SOUND OF THE DRAGON’S
BREATH. The SLEEPING BEAST, almost entirely hidden, is just a
few FEET away.
BILBO stares up at the GOLDEN MOUNTAIN towering above him and
comes to realize that SMAUG is indeed a MASSIVE size!
SMAUG exhales and SHIFTS in his sleep; BILBO watches as
MOUNTAINS of GOLD subtly heave and resettle throughout the
huge GALLERY.
CLOSE ON: SMAUG’S BULBOUS EYELID flickers and TWITCHES!
BILBO, still clutching the small GOLDEN CUP, is in SHOCK.
Keeping his eyes trained on the DRAGON, BILBO moves towards
the NARROW TUNNEL ENTRANCE, clutching the CUP in his hand.
ANGLE ON: A THIN, PIERCING RAY of RED, which emanates from
beneath the DROOPING LID of SMAUG’S LEFT EYE.
CLOSE ON: BILBO reaches into his POCKET and pulls out THE RING
as ... the EVIL LIGHT of SMAUG’S RED EYE sweeps across him.
BILBO stands poised with THE RING, too scared to move, as the
LIGHT of SMAUG’S EYE suddenly returns ... it fixes on the
little HOBBIT just as: BILBO jams THE RING on his FINGER and
instantly DISAPPEARS!
SMAUG’S SLY, SONOROUS VOICE fills the chamber.
SMAUG
(musing to himself)
Well, thief ...
SMAUG’S GREAT HEAD swings just above BILBO, his reptilian EYES
sliding from SIDE TO SIDE.
SMAUG (CONT’D)
I smell you - I hear your breath - I feel
your air ...
CLOSE ON: BILBO frozen in FEAR as SMAUG’s ENORMOUS HEAD looms
over him.
SMAUG (CONT’D)
(to himself)
Where are you? Where are you? ...
SUDDENLY BILBO turns and RUNS, skidding & sliding down the
MOUNDS of GOLD, the GIANT DRAGON following the MOVEMENT of the
precious COINS. BILBO flattens himself against the TUNNEL
ENTRANCE. The great EYE of SMAUG scans the ROOM.
84MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
SMAUG (CONT’D)
Come now, don’t be shy ... step into the
light....
SMAUG (CONT’D)
There is something about you ...
something you carry? Something made of
gold, but far more ... precious.
ANGLE ON: BILBO stares into the eyes of the GREAT BEAST as if
hypnotised ...
FLASH IMAGE: THE EYE OF SAURON! BILBO rips off the RING and
hides behind another PILLAR.
SMAUG (CONT’D)
(snide laugh)
There you are, thief in the Shadows!
BILBO is frozen on the spot, finding himself eye to eye with
the HUGE DRAGON.
BILBO
(quaking with fear)
I did not come here to steal from you, O
Smaug the Unassessably Wealthy, I merely
wanted to gaze upon your magnificence ...
to see if you were as great as the old
tales say. I did not believe them.
ANGLE ON: The GREAT DRAGON rises up ... his massive chest,
encrusted in jewels, glints in the LIGHT ...
SMAUG
And do you now?
BILBO
Truly the tales and songs fall utterly
short of your enormity, O Smaug, the
Stupendous!
SMAUG
Do you think flattery will keep you
alive?
BILBO
No ...?
SMAUG
No, indeed. You seem familiar with my
name, but I don’t remember smelling your
kind before. Who are you and where do you
come from, may I ask?
CLOSE ON: BILBO as he backs toward the safety of a pillar,
something catches his eye.
85MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
ANGLE ON: a RADIANT light emanates from within a mound of
TREASURE.
BILBO
(scrambling to answer)
I ... I ... I ...
BILBO edges towards the GLIMMERING LIGHT. Finally he can see
it clearly ... a beautiful jewel, it is the most MAGNIFICENT
thing he has ever seen. The ARKENSTONE!
BILBO (CONT’D)
(playing for time)
Well ... I come from Under the Hill.
SMAUG
Underhill ...
BILBO
And under hills and over hills my path
has led.
(growing confidence)
And through the air ... I am he who walks
unseen ...
SMAUG
Impressive ... what else do you claim to
be?
BILBO
I am Luck-wearer; Riddle-maker.
SMAUG
Lovely titles ... go on.
BILBO
Barrel-rider ...
SMAUG
Barrels ... Now, that is interesting.
CLOSE ON: BILBO starts backing away down the steep hill of
gold as SMAUG’S movements get more and more agitated creating
landslides of TREASURE.
SMAUG (CONT’D)
And what about your little Dwarf friends.
Where are they hiding?
BILBO
(panicked)
Dwarves?! There’s no Dwarves here. You’ve
got it all wrong!
SMAUG
Oh, I don’t think so, Barrel-rider. They
sent you in here to do their dirty work
while they skulk about outside.
86MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
SUDDENLY the ARKENSTONE slides away as SMAUG’S huge body
slides under the cloisters.
BILBO
(panicked)
Truly, you are mistaken, O Smaug,
Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities.
SMAUG
You have nice manners for a thief and
liar!
BILBO edges along the MOUND of GOLD trying to reach THE
ARKENSTONE -
SMAUG casts around wildly ... the ARKENSTONE slides further
away.
SMAUG (CONT’D)
I know the smell and taste of Dwarf - no-
one better ... It’s the gold - they are
drawn to treasure, like flies to dead
flesh.
ANGLE ON: SMAUG is starting to get enraged!
SMAUG (CONT’D)
(roaring with fury)
Did you think I did not know this day
would come ... that a pack of canting
Dwarves would come crawling back to the
Mountain?
A HUGE STONE COLUMN tumbles down.
EXT. HIDDEN BAY, LONELY MOUNTAIN
- NIGHT
BALIN and THORIN before the STATUE OF THROR... suddenly the
ground beneath their feet shakes!
CLOSE ON: THORIN spins around, staring into the darkness of
the SECRET DOOR.
DORI
What were that? Were that an earthquake?
BALIN looks at the others who are standing around nervously.
BALIN
(grimly)
That, my lad, was a dragon.
INT. BARD’S HOUSE - NIGHT
... BARD reacts as a SMALL TREMOR ripples through the HOUSE.
Plates rattle on shelves, low rumble can be heard.
87MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
SIGRID
(scared)
Da?!
BAIN
(worried)
It’s coming from the Mountain ...
BARD exchanges looks with FILI.
FILI
You should leave us - take your children -
get out of here.
BARD
And go where? There is nowhere to go.
TILDA
Are we going to die, Da?
CLOSE ON: BARD reading the fear in his little daughter’s eyes.
BARD
No, Darlin’ -
TILDA
But the dragon, it’s going to kill us.
BARD crosses to a HIDING PLACE - he withdraws a LONG, BLACK
ARROW.
BARD
Not if I kill it first.
INT. LONELY MOUNTAIN HALLS - NIGHT
Thin REDDISH FLAMES escape from SMAUG’S mouth and nostrils as
he LAUGHS ... a devastating sound which shakes the very
foundations of the MOUNTAIN. He smashes COLUMNS.
SMAUG
The King Under the Mountain is dead! I
took his throne! I ate his people like a
wolf among sheep. I kill where I wish,
when I wish! My armour is iron. No blade
can pierce me.
SMAUG suddenly whirls back around, his TAIL lashes furiously
SMASHING into columns bringing them crashing down!
EXT. MARKETPLACE, LAKE-TOWN - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: BARD and BAIN hurry through alleys. BARD is carrying
the BLACK ARROW wrapped in cloth. BAIN hurries to keep up.
88MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
BAIN
A Black Arrow - why did you never tell
me?
BARD
Because you did not need to know.
ANGLE ON: BARD and BAIN pause at a CORNER - the MASTER’S HALL
is ahead.
BARD (CONT’D)
Listen to me, carefully - I need you to
distract the guards ... once I’m at the
top of the tower I’ll set the arrow to
the bow.
BRAGA
There he is! Stop him!
BARD pushes BAIN along at speed, they duck around a corner.
The GUARDS give chase.
BARD thrusts the BLACK ARROW into BAIN’S hands.
BARD
Keep it safe. Don’t let anyone find it!
BAIN protests ...
BARD (CONT’D)
I’ll deal with them - go!
BAIN runs off, as BARD steps back around the corner to
confront the BRAGA.
BRAGA
You are under arrest.
BARD
On what charge?
BRAGA smiles with malicious ENJOYMENT.
BRAGA
Any charge the Master chooses.
BARD responds with a solid FIST - the CAPTAIN of the GUARD
stumbles backwards.
SUDDENLY - BARD breaks free, making a run for it. BRAGA and
the GUARDS set off in pursuit.
WIDE ON: BARD races across a CANAL, leap-frogging from one
BOAT to the NEXT ... GUARDS following tip into the WATER.
ANGLE ON: BARD races around a CORNER, looking back ... he’s
LOSING the MASTER’S GUARDS.
89MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
BARD is suddenly TOPPLED by a FOOT thrust out of the SHADOWS.
He stumbles to the GROUND ... THE MASTER stands over him,
clutching a LUMP of WOOD.
EXT. HIDDEN BAY, LONELY MOUNTAIN - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: A bright, ORANGE LIGHT flares in the dark TUNNEL.
ANOTHER SHAKE rattles the MOUNTAIN. ORI looks nervously down
down into the MOUNTAIN.
ORI
What about Bilbo?
THORIN
Give him more time.
BALIN
To do what? To be killed?
THORIN
You are afraid.
BALIN
Yes, I am afraid - I fear for you. A
sickness lies upon that treasure hoard -
a sickness that drove your Grandfather
mad.
THORIN
I am not my Grandfather.
BALIN
You are not yourself - the Thorin I know
would not hesitate -
THORIN
I will not risk the Quest for the life of
one burglar!
BALIN
Bilbo ... his name is Bilbo.
A even more violent SHAKE rumbles the GROUND.
INT. LONELY MOUNTAIN HALLS - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: SMAUG moves stealthily through the CHAMBER ... his
voice low and full of menace.
SMAUG (ADR PICK-UP)
It’s Oakensheild - that filthy, Dwarvish
usurper! He sent you in here for the
Arkenstone, didn’t he?
BILBO
No, no - I came of my own accord.
90MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
SMAUG
Don’t bother denying it - I guessed his
foul purpose some time ago. But it
matters not ... Oakenshield’s quest will
fail ...
INT. DOL GULDUR SOUTH TOWER - NIGHT
CLOSE ON: on GANDALF ... lying LIFELESS in an IRON CAGE,
suspended over the edge of the SOUTH TOWER. His EYES stare
unblinking and unseeing. His body is bruised and battered, his
hair matted with sweat and blood, it is obvious he has been
tortured.
SMAUG (O.S.)
... a darkness is coming ... it will
spread to every corner of the land.
ON THE SOUNDTRACK a LOW, HEAVY RUMBLING rises up from beneath
the SUSPENDED IRON CAGE.
CLOSE ON: GANDALF’s eye BLINKS into LIFE. Slowly turning his
head, the WIZARD stares down into the dark depths of the
RUINED FORTRESS. A look of HORROR falls over GANDALF’s face as
he takes in the sight below.
GANDALF POV: FIERY TORCHLIGHT flickers, illuminating RANK
after RANK of ARMOURED GUNDABAD ORCS ... the ground trembles
as HUGE, TROLL-LIKE CREATURES follow in the LEGIONS wake ...
disappearing into the darkness.
EXT. LAKE-TOWN ROOFTOPS - NIGHT
REVEAL: BOLG and the HUNTER ORC PACK stealthily creeping over
the roofs of LAKE-TOWN ...
BOLG HALTS ... as if sensing something.
BOLG
(BLACK SPEECH - unsubtitled)
Shûgi Khozd-shrakhun hum. Nuzdidiz.
The dwarf-rats are here somewhere ... I
can smell them.
INT. LONELY MOUNTAIN HALLS - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: BILBO, hiding behind a pillar, as he listens to the
sly voice of SMAUG.
SMAUG
You are being used, Thief in the Shadows
... you were only ever a means to an end.
The coward Oakensheild has weighed the
value of your life and found it worth
nothing.
91MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
ANGLE ON: BILBO as he tries to shake of the thought.
BILBO
No ... no ... you’re lying.
SMAUG
What did he promised you? A share of the
treasure - as if it was his to give! I
will not part with a single coin, not one
piece of it.
ANGLE ON: BILBO races towards THE ARKENSTONE as SMAUG flicks
his tail ... his massive body moves like lighting ... TREASURE
erupts in all directions, sending THE ARKENSTONE flying away
from BILBO.
SMAUG (CONT’D)
My teeth are swords! My claws are spears!
My wings are a hurricane!
SMAUG flexes his WINGS, rising up on his haunches, in an
awesome DISPLAY of POWER ...
BILBO stares in awe, then looks again ...
CLOSE ON: There, under one wing, is a bare patch of DRAGON
SKIN.
BILBO
(under his breath)
So it is true. The black arrow found it’s
mark.
SMAUG (ADR PICK-UP)
What did you say?
BILBO
(to SMAUG)
I was just saying your reputation
precedes you, O Smaug the Tyrannical,
truly you have no equal on this earth!
SMAUG‘s eyes fall to the FLOOR ... to something that lies near
BILBO. The HOBBIT follows the DRAGON’s gaze ... it is the
ARKENSTONE.
SMAUG
(soft laugh)
I am almost tempted to let you take it,
if only to see Oakenshield suffer - watch
it destroy him, watch it corrupt his
heart and drive him mad.
CLOSE ON: BILBO listening intently to SMAUG’s words ...
92MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13
SMAUG (CONT’D)
But I think not ... I think our little
game ends here ... so tell me, Thief, how
do you choose to die?
BILBO jams on the RING and disappears!
SMAUG roars and swats the spot where BILBO was just standing.
Enraged, he blasts the HALL with withering FLAMES!
INT. NARROW HALL, LONELY MOUNTAIN - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: Gold coins dislodged as an invisible BILBO runs
across the floor of a cavern and upstairs into a narrow
TUNNEL.
CLOSE ON: SMAUG thrusts his GHASTLY HEAD into the TUNNEL,
jamming his SNAPPING JAWS and ELONGATED NECK into the NARROW
OPENING.
RING WORLD: BILBO runs up the STAIRS, ducking behind a WALL
... he pulls off the RING.
CLOSE ON: BILBO stares at the RING in his HAND, his face
drenched in SWEAT - it is obvious he does not like using this
THING.
SMAUG’S dark FURY resounds through echoing TUNNELS and HALLS -
A HARSH BELLOWING SOUND, that seems to shake the very
foundations of the MOUNTAIN!
INT. LAKE-TOWN GAOL - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: BRAGA and the OTHER GUARDS laughing and drinking.
ANGLE ON: BARD’s eyes open ... he looks around ... he is lying
on the cold, hard floor of a GAOL CELL.
Another low rumble sounds from the MOUNTAIN ... BARD stares in
horror and he realises what is happening.
EXT. STREETS OF LAKE-TOWN/PIG STY, LAKE-TOWN - NIGHT
TOWNS-FOLK are emerging from their HOUSES, looking with
INCREASING CONCERN at the FIRE-LIGHT flickering above the
MOUNTAIN.
ANGLE ON: BOFUR ducks past distracted TOWNS-FOLK, unseen. He
desperately looks around for HERBS.

MOUTH!

ANGLE ON: HUNTER ORCS swarm up the WALLS and across the ROOF
of BARD’S HOUSE!

him ... the DWARF fights the ORC off bravely, but FIMBUL is
better armed and slashes at BOFUR.
INT. BARD’S HOUSE - NIGHT
BOLG’s ORCS break into BARD’S HOUSE, intent on killing the
DWARVES. BAIN, SIGRID and TILDA help the DWARVES - even the
WOUNDED KILI fights.
SUDDENLY! LEGOLAS and TAURIEL arrive, attacking the ORCS with
ELVISH SKILL and RUTHLESSNESS.
ANGLE ON: FIMBUL flees - leaping from BARD’s BALCONY, landing
in a small fishing boat. He calls to BOLG who is watching from
the shadows of a landing across the water.
FIMBUL
(BLACK SPEECH with subtitles)
Ekinskeld obguranid
Oakensheild has gone!
BOLG receives this news - his eyes glint in fury. He yells
commands to the remaining ORCS.
BOLG
(BLACK SPEECH unsubtitled)
Gur - arangim!
Fall back - regroup at the bridge!
LEGOLAS throws a DEAD ORC over the BALCONY causing FIMBUL to
hurtle into the air. In one swift move LEGOLAS decapitates
FIMBUL.
CLOSE ON: LEGOLAS watching the ORCS fleeing into the NIGHT.

BAIN, SIGRID and TILDA watch as LEGOLAS and TAURIEL
efficiently kill the HUNTER ORCS.

You killed them all.
LEGOLAS
Not all - there are others.
LEGOLAS turn and moves towards the DOOR.
LEGOLAS (CONT’D)
Tauriel, come.
CLOSE ON: TAURIEL is looking down at KILI.
KILI’s breathing is ragged; dark veins of black poison, run
beneath the skin on his face.
He is lying on the FLOOR. OIN holds KILI’s wrist in one hand
... the OLD DWARF looks up anxiously towards TAURIEL.
OIN
(anxious)
We are losing him.
LEGOLAS
(calling from door)
Tauriel!
LEGOLAS leaves ... TAURIEL goes to follow him, she looks back
at KILI.
ANGLE ON: BOFUR runs up the stairs still clutching the
KINGSFOIL. He stops at the sight of TAURIEL, but her eyes are
staring down at the WEED in his HAND. She takes the plant from
him.
TAURIEL
Athelas ...
BOFUR reacts as she begins crushing it between her fingers.
BOFUR
What are you doing?
CLOSE ON: TAURIEL ... a mix of hope and fear on her face as
stares at KILI.

THORIN
You’re alive!
BILBO
Not for much longer -
THORIN

The Dragon is coming -
THORIN
(urgent)
The Arkenstone - did you find it?

ORI tumbling down the stairs into the chamber ...
SMAUG rears up preparing to blast a wall of flame at them. The

You will burn ...!
THORIN
Run! Back the way you came - go!
96MIDDLE RIVERS - FIFTH DRAFT: 22/11/13

through his veins.
TAURIEL
Hold him down.
ANGLE ON: KILI convulses as FILI, OIN, BOFUR, SIGRID and TILDA
attempt to hold him down on the TABLE ...
TAURIEL stares at the wound ... shock flickers across her face
for a brief second as she takes in the gravity of the wound.
TAURIEL crushes the athelas, applying it to the wound ...
softly she begins to an ancient incantation - a spell of
healing.
TAURIEL (CONT’D)

Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin;

far away from me. She walks in starlight
in another world.

the collapsed rubble, still in the positions they suffocated
in two hundred years earlier ...

come here ... hoping beyond hope.

THORIN turns in time to see SMAUG bearing down upon them. He
has no time to reach the STAIRS.

(grimly)
Have we not?
ANGLE ON: THORIN stands at the edge of the MINE SHAFT - he

FLAME and CINDERS BLAST into SMAUG’S FACE.
ANGLE ON: BILBO reaches the LEVER, just as SMAUG - his FURY
unleashed - SMASHES through the ARCHES into the FORGES. THORIN
only just has time to DIVE out of his WAY.
THORIN yells to BILBO.
THORIN
Now!
BILBO hauls the LEVER down ... HUGE SLUICES OPEN, releasing a
TORRENT OF WATER into WOODEN SHUTES ... The line of MINE
BUCKETS hanging above start moving. DWALIN and NORI swing
HAMMERS at WOODEN POSTS supporting the CHUTES, sending the
WATER straight into SMAUG.
ANGLES ON: the cold WATER smashes into the hot DRAGON. SMAUG
arches in PAIN, STEAM spitting from his HIDE ... he THRASHES
WILDLY.
ANGLE ON: ORI and DWALIN race out, THROWING the FLASH-FLAME
BOMBS, which explode against SMAUG with a BLINDING FLASH.
SMAUG turns on the DWARVES ... the overhead MINE BUCKETS
moving above him.

BUCKET TRAIN ... another LINE of HEAVY BUCKETS fall on SMAUG,
as BIFUR and GLOIN swing down like a pendulum, clinging onto
their BUCKETS.
THORIN (CONT’D)
(calling)
Lead him to the Gallery of the Kings!
ANGLE ON: SMAUG spins wildly, sending the BUCKETS flying like
missiles. The BUCKETS hit WINCHES and LEVERS, activating HUGE
WATERWHEELS ... old RUSTY MACHINERY GROANS into life.
ANGLE ON: BILBO ducks a FLYING BUCKET, but another smashes the
STAIRCASE he’s standing on, sending him ROLLING onto the
floor.
ANGLES ON: THORIN takes his chance - he races under SMAUG’S
THRASHING BELLY, grabbing a WOODEN WHEEL BARROW, and throws it
into the FLOW of MOLTEN GOLD, leaping in after it.
THORIN lands on the WOODEN BARROW, and ducks as he disappears
into the TUNNEL with the flow of MOLTEN GOLD.
THORIN (CONT’D)
(calling)
Keep going Bilbo - run!
SMAUG turns on BILBO, about to BLAST FLAME on him ... BILBO
turns and runs ... SMAUG blasts FIRE straight at BILBO!
INT. GOLD TUNNEL, LONELY MOUNTAIN - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: THORIN floating down the fast flowing MOLTEN GOLD

The tunnel suddenly opens up, the GOLD POURING over the lip
into the OPEN NECK of a MASSIVE CLAY MOLD.

SMAUG’s huge head turns this way and that as he seeks out
BILBO.
SMAUG
You think you can deceive me, “barrel-
rider”? You have come from Lake-town!
CLOSE ON: BILBO PEERS OUT from under the FALLEN TAPESTRY as
SMAUG stalks right past him, searching the HALL. He is
HORRIFIED by SMAUG’S WORDS.
SMAUG (CONT’D)
This is some sordid scheme hatched
between these filthy Dwarves and those
miserable tub-trading Lake-men. Those
snivelling cowards with their long bows
and black arrows.
CLOSE ON: BILBO, dawning realisation of SMAUG’s intent.
SMAUG (ADR PICK-UP) (CONT’D)
Perhaps it is time I paid them a visit.

SMAUG (ADR PICK-UP)
You will take nothing from me, Dwarf! I
laid low the warriors of old, I instilled
terror in the hearts of men. I am ‘King
Under the Mountain’!
THORIN
This is not your kingdom. These are Dwarf
lands, Dwarf gold - and we will have our
revenge!
(Dwarvish unsubtitled)
Igritu zû!
Let him have it!
ANGLES ON: DWALIN, NORI, BIFUR, BOMBUR, DORI, GLOIN and ORI

holding it together.

The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies

[Opening scene: We see Laketown, with the Lonely Mountain in the distance. Bells are ringing, and people are frantically loading their possessions into boats. In his house, the Master of Laketown is overseeing his soldiers and servants carrying boxes containing his gold and valuables.]

[Master:] “I warned you. Did I not warn you what would come of dealing with dwarves?! Now they’ve done it! They’ve woken the dragon. They brought the apocalypse upon our heads! Come on! Quickly! Quickly!”

[The Master pulls a candlestick in the wall sideways; it turns out to be a secret lever, and a nearby bookshelf falls backward to reveal a hidden staircase and boat landing with the Master’s boat waiting.]

[Master:] “Faster now! I’m trying to evacuate myself here! Careful, men. Never mind the books! Get on, get the rest of it!”

[Guard #1:] “But Sire, should we not try to save the town?”

[Master:] “The town is lost! Save the gold!”

[Guard #2:] “You heard him.”

[The men load all the gold and other valuables onto the Master’s boat.]



[The townspeople frantically paddle their loaded boats through the canals. Tauriel watches the sky ominously; with her elf-hearing, she can hear Smaug approaching and roaring. Suddenly, a huge shadow swoops overhead. Smaug has arrived.]

[Tauriel enter’s Bard’s house and prepares the dwarves and Bard’s family to leave.]

[Tauriel:] “We have no time. We must leave!”

[Bofur:] “Get him up.”

[Fili:] “Come on, brother.”

[Bofur:] “Come on, come on! Let’s go.”

[Kili:] “I’m fine - I can walk.”

[Tauriel:] “As fast as you can.”

[Bain:] “We’re not leaving. Not without our father.”

[Tauriel:] “If you stay here, your sisters will die. Is that what your father would want?”



[Bard is in the prison, and all the men guarding him are gone. He clutches the cell bars and shouts.]

[Bard:] “Open the door! Do you hear me!”

[He stops as he sees Smaug flying high above the town, then frantically tries to break the lock. When it doesn’t break, he rushes to the other side of his jail cell, which is on an arch of a building overhanging a canal.] 



[Tauriel, the dwarves, and Bard’s family get on a boat at the back of the house.] 

[Fili:] “Give me your hand.”

[Bofur:] “Come on, we gotta go!”

[Tauriel:] “Quickly now! Hurry!”

[Fili:] “Kili, come on!”

[They set off down the canal, poling the boat through the floating chunks of ice. Smaug swoops low overhead, and the townspeople scream.]

[Smaug soars high above and away from the town, then turns and dives steeply toward the town, building up fire in his chest. As he gets over the town, he unleashes his flames, and he breathes his fire in a line all the way across the town. People scream and fall and die in the inferno.]

[Bard smashes at his cell’s bars with a pail, but to no avail.]

[Smaug breathes fire over another section of the town; a man, on fire, falls out of his house and into the water.]



[The Master, his men, and Alfrid pole their boat loaded with treasure through the water, with Smaug setting things to fire around them.]

[Master:] “Come on! Come on! Faster! FASTER!”

[Master:] “If only we could take more of these poor people with us, but they are hardly-”

[Alfrid:] “-worth it. I quite agree.”

[A man tries to climb onto the boat, but Alfrid kicks him in the face and back into the water.]



[Bard tears his blanket into strips. People are trampling each other in their efforts to escape the dragon and the fire.]

[Bain:] “Look out!”

[The Master’s boat collides with Tauriel’s, upsetting everyone. They manage to push their boats apart, but some of the Master’s treasure falls into the water.]

[Master:] “Move it! Move it! Come on, faster!” 

[Master:] “My gold, my GOLD!”

[Alfrid:] “We’re carrying too much weight. We need to dump something!”

[While Alfrid looks at the pile of treasure, trying to decide what to throw overboard, the Master looks at him greedily.]

[Master:] “You’re quite right, Alfrid.”

[The Master pushes Alfrid overboard, just as a cloth loops falls from above and catches around the Master’s throat. It is the rope Bard made from his blanket; he has tied one end to his cell bars and let the other end, the loop, out of the window and over the canal, where it has conveniently caught the Master. Braga, at the front of the boat, hasn’t seen this.]

[Braga:] “Faster! Faster!”

[As the boat pulls ahead, the rope loops pulls the Master back, but then he gets stuck in front of the boat’s rear post. As the rope tightens around him, he gags and chokes. Eventually, the pressure is so much that the entire side of Bard’s prison break, and Bard escapes. The Master frantically pulls the rope away from his throat.]

[As Smaug flies overhead, still blowing flames, Bard breaks through the guardroom window and grabs his bow and quiver, testing his bowstring. He pushes out some of the shingles in the upper story and clambers out onto the roof, where he has a good vantage point. He ducks low as Smaug flies by almost overhead. Bard runs across the rooftops, heading toward the bell tower, the tallest building in the town.]



[Back at the Lonely Mountain, Thorin and Company watch the town burning in the lake.]

[Balin:] “Poor souls.”

[They all stare at each other in sadness and fear. Bilbo looks back and sees that Thorin is staring back at the halls of Erebor, not at Laketown. Bilbo looks worried.]



[Bard continues leaping roof to roof. Tauriel hides her boat under an overhang until she sees that it’s safe to go on. Bard climbs rapidly up the winding steps of the bell tower. Once at the top, he pulls all the arrows out of his quiver and looks out at the sky. As Smaug soars by, Bard shoots an arrow at him; however, the arrow merely bounces off Smaug’s scales and falls to the ground. Bard, standing directly below the ringing bell, gets nauseated by the booming sound, so he pulls out his dagger and cut’s the bell’s rope, silencing it. He shoots another arrow at Smaug, but this, like the first bounces harmlessly off. In the canals below, Bain, on the boat with his family, the dwarves, and Tauriel, notices his father at the top of the tower.]

[Bain:] “Da!”

[Tilda:] “DA!”

[As they watch, Bard shoots yet another arrow, harmlessly hitting the dragon.]

[Kili:] “He hit it! He hit the dragon!”

[Tauriel:] “No...”

[Kili:] “He did! He hit his mark, I saw!”

[Tauriel:] “His arrows cannot pierce its hide; I fear nothing will.”

[Bain looks down disconsolately, then suddenly looks up and notices the state of the Master of Laketown, and below it, the boat in which he’d hidden the Black Arrow his father had asked him to keep safe. Bain’s face turns to a determined look. As their boat passes under a hanging hook, Bain leaps up and grabs it, swinging clear of the boat. The other grab at him and miss, and they yell after him.]

[Bofur:] “What are you doing?!”

[Fili:] “Come back! Bain, come back!”

[Bain uses the hook and the crane it is attached to to swing to the dock, from where he runs toward the boat with the Black Arrow.]

[Tauriel:] “Leave him! We cannot go back!”

[Tilda:] “Bain!”



[At the top of the tower, Bard reaches for his arrows, only to find one left. He hesitates in fear, then grabs it and shoots Smaug. This time, Smaug passes so close to the tower that the wind knocks Bard over. Smaug howls, feeling the arrow, although it didn’t hurt him. Suddenly, Bain appears at the top of the bell tower, shocking Bard.]

[Bain:] “Dad!”

[Bard:] “Bain?! What are you doing?! Why didn’t you leave?! You were supposed to leave!”

[Bain:] “I came to help you.”

[Bard:] “No! Nothing can stop him now!”

[Bain:] “This might.”

[Bain holds up the Black Arrow. His father gratefully looks at it, then stroke’s Bain’s face.]

[Bard:] “Bain - you go back. You get out of here now!”

[Looking beyond Bard, Bain sees Smaug approaching the tower rapidly, Smaug having determined where the arrows were coming from.]

[Bain:] “DAD!”

[Smaug smashes through the top part of the bell tower. Bard finds himself lying down on the remaining top of the tower.]

[Bard:] “BAIN!”

[Bain is hanging by one arm to the remains of the tower; he has the Black Arrow in the other. Bard grabs Bain’s arm and hauls him back up. Meanwhile, Smaug lands closeby in the town, crushing buildings underneath him. He is directly in the way of the Master’s boat.]

[Master:] “Stop! Stop! Halt! Halt!”

[Bard pulls the Black Arrow out of the hands of the petrified Bain and stands up, facing Smaug. Smaug looks at him.] 

[Smaug:] “Who are you that would stand against me?!”

[Bard grabs his bow, only to find that it was broken in half when Smaug smashed into the tower earlier.]

[Smaug:] “Now that is a pity. What will you do now, Bowman? You are forsaken. No help will come.”

[Bard looks around frantically, but there is nothing to help him. Smaug begins walking toward him, crushing the buildings beneath him. The Master sees his chance and yells to his oarsmen.]

[Master:] “Now’s our chance! Go! Go! Into the open water!”

[Looking at the tower, Smaug growls and licks his lips. He continues speaking to Bard.]

[Smaug:] “Is that your child? You cannot save him from the fire. He will BURN!”

[As Smaug continues to approach, Bard fixes the two broken halves of his bow into the walls of the belltower, with the bowstring taut between them. He fixes the Black Arrow to the bowstring, and lays the front end of the Black Arrow on the shoulder of Bain, who is standing in between the fixed pieces of the bow and facing Bard. Bain pants in fear since he can hear Smaug approaching from behind him, but can’t see him.]

[Bard:] “Stay still, son. Stay still.”

[Smaug:] “Tell me, wretch - How now shall you challenge me?!”

[Bard notices a missing scale on Smaug’s chest, the scale that was broken by Girion, Lord of Dale. A small smile crosses Bard’s face.]

[Smaug:] “You have nothing left, but your DEATH!”

[Smaug howls, approaching more rapidly. Bain looks over his shoulder at the dragon, but Bard calls him back.]

[Bard:] “Bain! Look at me. You look at me.”

[Bard strains with the effort of holding the Black Arrow taut.]

[Bard:] “A little to your left.”

[Bain shifts a little to his left, moving the tip of the arrow to the right, toward the spot where Bard noticed the missing scale on Smaug.]

[Bard:] “That’s it.”

[Bard releases the Black Arrow and it flies off at high speed from Bain’s shoulder. It hurtles through the air and sinks all the way to the feathers, almost 6-7 feet, into Smaug’s chest through the spot without a scale. As Smaug leaps forward in pain and fear, Bard grabs Bain, just as Smaug careens into the tower. Bard and Bain fall with the tower into the water as Smaug rolls and slides through the town, destroying everything in the town. He struggles to fly into the sky. With massive effort, he manages to flap a few hundred feet up, screaming and wheezing in pain, then gasps for breath. His eyes lose their light, and he falls back down upon the city, dead, with the end of the arrow sticking out of his heart. He lands directly upon the Master’s boat, crushing it and presumably killing everyone on board.]



[The sound of Smaug hitting the ground echoes throughout the land, all the way to the dwarves on the mountain. They jump up in surprise.]

[Oin:] “What was that? What happened?”

[Bilbo:] “It fell. I saw it.”

[They all peer out at the town in the early morning light.]

[Bilbo:] “It’s dead. Smaug is dead!”

[Thorin, still staring at the Lonely Mountain and not at the town, has a strange expression of happiness cross his face.]

[Gloin:] “By my beard! I think he’s right! Look there! The ravens of Erebor are returning to the mountain!”

[Several birds can be seen cawing and approaching the Lonely Mountain.]

[Oin:] “Aye - Word will spread. Before long every soul in Middle-earth will know - The dragon is dead!”

[As the dwarves laugh in glee, Thorin hurries down from the lookout point and approaches the gates of Erebor.]

[On screen:] THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES



[In Dol Guldur, Gandalf languishes in his cage. Suddenly, Galadriel’s voice sounds in his head, and he looks up with a start.]

[Galadriel:] “You are not alone, Mithrandir…”

[Galadriel:] “... (Ae boe) i le eliathon, im tulithon.” [not translated onscreen: If you should ever need my help, I will come.]” 



[It is early morning. On the banks of the lake are refugees and wreckage from Laketown. People are screaming and crying, and some of the wooden things are on fire. There are dead bodies washed up on the shore. Alfrid comes crawling up out of the water, screaming.]

[Alfrid:] “Will somebody help me? HELP!”

[He clambers over a dead body, only to realize that the person is still alive. Alfrid rolls over him into the water, screaming.]

[Alfrid:] “HELP!”

[Meanwhile, some of the survivors begin helping each other and salvaging whatever supplies they can. Tauriel, Sigrid, and Tilda walk about, looking for Bard.]

[Sigrid:] “DA!”

[Tilda:] “DA!”

[Sigrid:] “DA!”

[Alfrid screams up into the sky.]

[Alfrid:] “WHY ME?”

[There is still screaming and crying all about, as people pull the bodies of their loved ones out of the water and onto the shore. The dwarves, Oin, Bofur, and Fili, grab a boat and begin to push it out into the water. Kili approaches Tauriel.]

[Kili:] “Tauriel.”

[Fili:] “Kili, come on! We’re leaving.”

[Tauriel:] “They are your people - You must go.”

[Tauriel looks at Kili both sadly and guardedly, then walks past him. Kili looks distraught for a second, then whirls around to face her again.]

[Kili:] “Come with me. I know how I feel; I’m not afraid. You make me feel alive.”

[Tauriel turns her head away.]

[Tauriel:] “I can’t.”

[Kili reaches out and grabs her arm, then says something in Dwarvish.]

[Kili:] “Tauriel, amralime” (presumably, “Tauriel, my love”)

[Hearing this, Tauriel looks at Kili, shocked and surprised.]

[Tauriel:] “I don’t know what that means.”

[Kili smiles.]

[Kili:] “I think you do.”

[Tauriel smiles and begins to lean toward Kili, but then suddenly straightens up and makes her face blank. She addresses Legolas, whom she sensed approaching behind her.]

[Tauriel:] “Hîr nín, Legolas.” [Subtitle: My Lord Legolas.]

[Kili looks with hostility over Tauriel’s shoulder at Legolas.] 

[Legolas:] “Maewado i Naug.” [Subtitle: Take your leave of the Dwarf.]

[Legolas:] “Boe i nadh egeno.” [Subtitle: You are needed elsewhere.]

[Tauriel looks at Kili for a few more seconds, then, torn by her duty, begins to turn away. Kili sadly turns toward his friends launching the boat. He suddenly pauses, then turns around and hurries back to Tauriel. He takes her hand and places his black stone into it, folding her fingers closed over it. She gasps and looks at him as he gets close to her face and holds her hands to his heart.]

[Kili:] “Keep it. As a promise.”

[They smile at each other, then Kili runs toward the boat. Legolas looks on, confused. Tauriel looks down at the stone in her hand, then looks after Kili and the dwarves in the boat; her eyes are wet. Kili looks back at her for several moments, then begins rowing.]



[Meanwhile on shore, the woman from earlier who spoke about the prophecy hurries about, handing out blankets to the survivors.]

[Woman:] “These are dry. You need them.”

[Man:] “Thank you.”

[Alfrid pushes between people as he approaches the woman.]

[Alfrid:] “Oi! Give me one of them! I’ll catch my death in this cold!”

[Woman:] “Oh, find your own! You’re not in charge now, Alfrid Blackspell!”

[Alfrid:] “That is where you are wrong - In absence of the Master, the power cedes to his deputy, which in this instance is my good self. Now give me that blanket!”

[He leans forward and grabs the blanket; she pulls back on the other end. They tug over it, yelling at each other.]

[Woman:] “Master’s deputy? Don’t make me laugh.”

[She manages to pull the blanket away and begins hitting Alfrid with it.]

[Woman:] “You’re a sneak-thief, more like. I’ll be dead, before I answer to the likes of you!”

[As she turns away, Alfrid grabs her.]

[Alfrid:] “Maybe that can be arranged!”

[Alfrid raises his hand to strike her, only to have someone else grab his upraised arm. It turns out to be Bard, who leans close to Alfrid.]

[Bard:] “I wouldn’t go turning on your own, Alfrid. Not now!”

[Bard spins Alfrid around, and Alfrid trips and falls over Bain’s outstretched foot. Bain and the Woman smile. Sigrid and Tilda come running out of the crowd.]

[Tilda:] “DA!”

[Bard:] “Come here!”

[Bard grabs up his daughters in a huge hug. He clutches them to himself as the townspeople look on.]

[Bard:] “It’s alright.”

[A man, Percy (who used to check the papers of the boats entering town), steps out of the crowd and exclaims loudly.]

[Percy:] “It was Bard! He killed the dragon! I saw it with my own eyes. He brought the beast down. He shot him dead, with a black arrow.”

[The people begin cheering for Bard and laying their hands on him, exclaiming their thanks.]

[Various Townspeople:] “You saved us all! Thank you.”

[Alfrid suddenly appears and raises Bard’s arm, then cheers loudly for him.]

[Alfrid:] “ALL HAIL - TO THE DRAGONSLAYER! ALL HAIL - KING BARD!”

[The people grow silent, and Bard yanks his hand away from Alfrid’s. Alfrid, still with his hand up in the air, speaks to the crowd.]

[Alfrid:] “I have said it many times - This is a man of noble stock. A born leader!”

[Bard:] “Do not call me that! I’m not the master of this town.”

[Bard looks around.]

[Bard:] “WHERE IS HE? WHERE’S THE MASTER?”

[Woman:] “Halfway down the Anduin, with all our coin, I don’t doubt. You would know!”

[She points at Alfrid, who looks scared.]

[Woman:] “You helped him empty the treasury.”

[Alfrid:] “No - I tried to stop him.”

[Alfrid raises his voice and addresses all the people, scared and pleadingly. The people yell at him angrily, calling him a traitor and a mongrel. Alfrid hides behind Bard, keeping Bard between himself and the Woman.]

[Alfrid:] “I pleaded. I pleaded. I said, ’Master - NO!’”

[As the people continue to yell abuse at him, Alfrid looks terrified.]

[Alfrid:] “Think of the children.”

[Alfrid grabs Tilda and holds her in front of him.]

[Alfrid:] “Will nobody think of the children?!”

[Tilda angrily stomps on Alfrid’s foot, forcing him to let go of her. The people yell for Alfrid’s head.]

[Man:] “To the tree with you!”

[Several men grab Alfrid and raise him up, preparing to hang him with a rope. He screams with fear. Bard steps in and stops the people.]

[Bard:] “Enough! Let him go! Let him go!”

[The people quiet down and let Alfrid fall to the ground. Bard turns about, addressing them all.]

[Bard:] “Look around you! Have you not had your fill of death?”

[Alfrid pops up.]

[Alfrid:] “Aye.”

[Bard pushes him back down.]

[Bard:] “Winter is upon us; we must look to our own, to the sick and the helpless. Those who can stand, tend to the wounded. And those who have strength left - follow me. We must salvage what we can.”

[Bard turns and begins to stride through the crowd.]

[Woman:] “What then? What do we do then?”

[Bard:] “We find shelter.”

[The townspeople begin to follow him as he walks away.]



[Fili, Kili, Bofur, and Oin climb up the Lonely Mountain. As they approach the gates, they stop in shock and fear as they see the destruction caused by Smaug as he smashed through the front gate to fly out of the mountain. They look at each other, then run into the halls of Erebor. Bofur calls out, his voice echoing in the silence.]

[Bofur:] “Hello! Bombur? Bifur? Anybody?”

[They clamber through the halls, looking for their kin. As they run down a staircase, Bilbo runs up toward them from another part of the city, calling out.]

[Bilbo:] “WAIT! WAIT!”

[Oin:] “It’s Bilbo! He’s alive!”

[Bilbo:] “Stop! Stop! Stop!”

[They meet each other in a corridor.]

[Bilbo:] “You need to leave. We all need to leave.”

[Bofur:] “We only just got here?!”

[Bilbo:] “I have tried talking to him, but he won’t listen.”

[Oin:] “What do you mean, laddie?”

[Bilbo:] “THORIN. Thorin. Thorin. He’s been out there for days. He doesn’t sleep. He barely eats. He’s not been himself - not at all. It’s this - It’s this place. I think a sickness lies on it.”

[As Bilbo speaks, Fili looks past him and sees something that causes him to wrinkle his face in consternation.]

[Kili:] “Sickness? What kind of sickness?”

[Fili walks past the group and starts heading further down into Erebor, looking at something. Bilbo and the others run after him, trying to stop him.

[Bilbo:] “Fili. Fili. Fili!”

[As they continue heading down, a golden light begins to be visible on the walls. They round a corner, and stop short at the sight of Smaug’s treasure, heaped so high over the floor of the cavern that the ground is barely visible. As they stare, they see Thorin, dressed in ornate robes and covered in jewelry, stride slowly out of a doorway. Thorin begins speaking softly, apparently to himself. He looks strange, almost possessed, and the dwarves look at him in surprise.]

[Thorin:] “Gold - Gold beyond measure. Beyond sorrow and grief.”

[Thorin looks up and sees the others standing there.]

[Thorin:] “Behold - the great treasure hoard of Thror.”

[He suddenly flings something high into the air to where the dwarves are standing on a stairwell landing, and Fili catches it. It is a giant bloodred jewel.]

[Thorin:] “Welcome, my sister’s sons, to the kingdom of EREBOR.”



[The newly-come dwarves enter the room where the other dwarves are, and they greet each other warmly with massive hugs.]

[Bofur:] “Balin!”

[Nori:] “Kili!”

[Bofur:] “Bombur!”



[All the dwarves comb through the piles of treasure, searching for the Arkenstone.]

[Thorin:] “Any sign of it?!”

[Dwalin:] “Nothing yet.”

[Nori:] “Nothing here.”

[Thorin:] “Keep searching!”

[Oin:] “That jewel could be anywhere!”

[Thorin:] “The Arkenstone is in these halls - find it!”

[Dwalin:] “You heard him - Keep looking!”

[Thorin:] “All of you - No one rests until it is found!” 

[Bilbo, hearing all this, looks awkward.]


[Bilbo walks out onto the ramparts of the front gates, near the hole Smaug made in the wall. He paces back and forth for a while. Then, after looking around to see that no one is watching, he sits down. He thinks back to his encounter with Smaug, when he is standing near the Arkenstone and Smaug is speaking to him.]

FLASHBACK - START

[Smaug:] “I am almost tempted to let you take it, if only to see Oakenshield suffer, watch it destroy him, watch it corrupt his heart and drive him mad.”

[Samgu growls and extends his neck to eat Bilbo, but Bilbo puts on his ring and slips away. Unseen by Smaug, Bilbo grabs the Arkenstone and hides it in his tunic. Smaug angrily begins breathing fire.]

FLASHBACK - END

[Once more checking than no one is watching, he reaches into his tunic and pulls out the Arkenstone. He stares at it, as it glows with patterns of light from within.]



[At the Laketown camp, the people are packing supplies and getting ready to leave.]

[Bard:] “Take only what you need. We have a long march ahead.”

[Legolas:] “Where will you go?”

[Bard looks across the lake.]

[Bard:] “Where is only one place.”

[Alfrid:] “The mountain! You are a genius, sire. We can take refuge inside the mountain. It might smell a bit of dragon - The women can clean up. It will be safe and warm and dry, and full of stores, bedding, clothing...the odd bit of gold.”

[Bard:] “What gold is in that mountain is cursed. We will take only what was promised to us - only what we need to rebuild our lives.”

[Bard dumps a bundle of sticks he was packing into Alfrid’s hands and walks off. Alfrid then dumps the sticks into the hands of an old woman who already has a load of sticks.]

[Alfrid:] “Here - pull your weight!“

[Legolas:] “News of the death of Smaug will have spread through the lands.”

[Bard:] “Aye.”

[Legolas:] “Other will now look to the mountain - for its wealth, or its position.”

[Bard:] “What is it you know?”

[Legolas:] “Nothing for certain. It’s what I fear may come.”

[Legolas, looking concerned, looks off into the distance.]



[Azog is riding his white warg at the head of a vast company of Orcs, all armed for battle. They are crossing a rocky plain, with the Lonely Mountain in the distance as their destination. Bolg, riding his Warg, charges in from Laketown to deliver his message to Azog.]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Woodland Elves!]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: The King’s son and a She-elf - They tracked us down to Laketown.]

[Azog raises his arm, the hand of which Thorin cut off but is now replaced with a large blade, and the legions of Orcs stop.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: And you killed them?]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: They fled squealing like cowards]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: You fool! They will return with an Army of Elves at their backs!]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Ride to Gundabad.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Let the Legions come forth.]

[Bolg grunts in assent and rides off. Azog turns and faces his Orcs, raising his bladed arm.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Elves! Men! Dwarves! The Mountain will be their tomb!]

[He turns and begins riding toward the Mountain.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: To war!]



[Tauriel and Legolas stride through the Laketown camp.]

[Tauriel:] “You saw something out there.”

[Legolas:] “The orc I pursued out of Laketown - I know who he is. Bolg - a spawn of Azog the Defiler. A warg pack was waiting for him on the outskirts of Esgaroth. They fled into the north. These orcs were different from the others. They wore a mark I had not seen for a long time. The mark of Gundabad.”

[Tauriel stops in shock and turns to Legolas.]

[Tauriel:] “Gundabad?”

[Legolas:] “An orc-stronghold in the far north of the Misty Mountains.”

[An elf from Mirkwood rides up on a horse and addresses Legolas.]

[Elf:] “Hîr nín, Legolas. Celin ’winiath o adar lín.” [Subtitle: My Lord Legolas, I bring word from your Father.]

[Elf:] “Cân i hi danwenidh na le.” [Subtitle: You are to return to him immediately.] 

[Legolas:] “Tolo, Tauriel.” [Subtitle: Come, Tauriel.]

[Elf:] “Hîr nín. Edlennen Tauriel.” [Subtitle: My Lord, Tauriel is banished.]

[Legolas:] “Edlennen?” [Subtitle: Banished?]

[Both Legolas and Tauriel are surprised.]

[Legolas:] “You may tell my father: If there is no place for Tauriel, there is no place for me”

[Tauriel:] “Legolas. It is your King’s command”

[Legolas:] “Naw aran nín, mal ú-gân innas nín.” [Subtitle: Yes, he is my King. But he does not command my heart.]

[Legolas turns and walks away from the elven messenger.]

[Legolas:] “I ride north. Will you come with me?”

[Tauriel:] “To where?”

[Legolas:] “To Gundabad.”

[Tauriel and Legolas ride out of the Laketown camp on Legolas’s horse. The townspeople, carrying their possessions and stretchers with their sick and injured, begin the long trek around the lake and toward the Mountain.]



[In Dol Guldur, Gandalf begins chanting something while hanging in the cage. Meanwhile, Radagast is chanting in his home.]

[Gandalf:] “_ _ _”

[Radagast:] “_ _ _”

[Gandalf:] “_ _ _”

[An Orc approaches Gandalf, his sword bared.]
 
[Orc:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Spells will not save you, old man.]

[Meanwhile, Galadriel walks through the ruins of Dol Guldur, barefoot, her ring shining with a white light in the darkness.] 

[The orc throws Gandalf, still in his cage, around, while Gandalf cries out in pain.]

[Galadriel approaches Gandalf’s location, his cries of pain sounding loudly in the night as the Orc abuses him.]

[The Orc pulls open the cage and lifts Gandalf up with one arm.]

[Orc:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: This is my Master’s domain.]

[He throws Gandalf forcefully down onto the floor.]

[Orc:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Die now Wizard!]

[Galadriel appears, and the Orc sees her. The Orc roars, then runs at Galadriel. Galadriel lifts her arm, and a shockwave of power and energy expands all around her, lighting up the sky for miles around, as loose rubble flies around from the massive pressure.]

[With the Orc dead, Galadriel picks up Gandalf, who is almost dead, and walks through the ruins carrying him.]

[Sauron’s voice speaks out of the darkness, and Galadriel stops.]

[Sauron:] “Shre nazg golugranu kilmi-nudu” [Subtitle: Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky.]

[Sauron:] “Ombi kuzddurbagu gundum-ishi” [Subtitle: Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone.]

[Galadriel:] “Nine for mortal men doomed to die.”

[Galadriel looks around in shock as the nine Nazgul slowly become visible around her, in corporeal yet partially translucent forms. As they slowly draw closer, wielding their weapons, Galadriel stumbles back until she is sitting on the pedestal of a statue in a courtyard, with Gandalf in her lap. Still unconscious, Gandalf groans.]

[Sauron:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: You cannot fight the shadow. Even now you fade. One light alone in the darkness.]

[Gandalf looks up with a determined face.]

[Galadriel:] “I am not alone.”

[Behind the Nazgul, Elrond and Saruman stride out of the ruins, Elrond wielding his sword and Saruman his staff.]

[Saruman:] “Are you in need of assistance, my Lady?”

[Snarling, the Nazgul leap forward to confront them.]

[Elrond:] “You should have stayed dead.”

[Elrond and Saruman leap forward, attacking the Nazgul. The Nazgul disappear every time they are hit, yet they keep coming back. Saruman throws a Nazgul off a cliff, but it manages to clamber back up the cliff and resumes attacking. Despite this, Saruman and Elrond are still fighting incredibly well.]

[Galadriel talks to Gandalf.]

[Galadriel:] “Mithrandir, come back.”

[As Saruman and Elrond fight in the background, Galadriel leans down and kisses Gandalf’s head. He suddenly breathes in deeply and wakes up, gasping for breath.]

[Gandalf:] “He is here.”

[Galadriel:] “Yes - the darkness has returned.”

[As the others continue fighting, Radagast appears in the courtyard on his rabbit-pulled sled.]

[Radagast:] “GANDALF! Gandalf, climb on!”

[As Gandalf tries to get on the sled, Galadriel lays on the floor, weakened from bringing Gandalf back from the brink of death. She tries to help him up, but she is too weak.]

[Galadriel:] “He is weak. He cannot remain here - It is draining his life.”

[Gandalf manages to get on the sled, and Radagast prepares to leave.]

[Galadriel:] “Go! Quickly!”

[Gandalf reaches back and grabs Galadriel’s arm. He speaks to her, his voice still hoarse and weak.]

[Gandalf:] “Come with me, my Lady.”

[Galadriel looks at him sadly, then pulls her arm away with an effort. Her skin becomes white and her eyes and body shine with a strange, powerful, and dark light. She turns to face the Nazgul.]

[Galadriel:] “NO!”

[As Radagast and Gandalf ride off, Galadriel lays on the floor, surrounded by fighting Nazgul and Elrond and Saruman. Eventually, Elrond and Saruman manage to kill all the Nazgul, and they pause for breath. As they approach Galadriel to see if she’s alright, the wind picks up, then a nearby tower explodes in a massive ball of fire. In its place is the flaming eye of Sauron. Saruman and Elrond flinch in the face of its power.]

[Sauron:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: It has begun.]

[Sauron:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: The East will fall. So shall the Kingdom of Angmar rise.]

[The pupil of the Eye expands to reveal Saruon’s old form. Beside him rise the Nazgul, all of whom he has resurrected.]

[Sauron:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: The time of the Elves is over. The Age of the Orc has come.]

[As the Nazgul raise their weapons and approach, Elrond and Saruman prepare to fight, only to step back as Galadriel rises. Galadriel is glowing with a green light, and her entire appearance has changed to one of power. She raises her hand, in which is a bright light coming from the Phial of Galadriel, and the Nazgul are blasted away, back into the Eye.]

[Galadriel:] “YOU HAVE NO POWER HERE, SERVANT OF MORGOTH!”

[The fire around the Eye disappears, leaving only Sauron’s armored form. Sauron is chanting as well. He begins flashing in the fire of his Eye.]

[Galadriel:] “YOU ARE NAMELESS, FACELESS, FORMLESS!”

[As she speaks, her voice changes into a deep, booming, and powerful tone. The Eye keeps flashing with fire and chanting in Black Speech, while Elrond and Saruman raise their hands to shield themselves from the battle of power between Galadriel and Sauron.]

[Galadriel:] “GO BACK TO THE VOID FROM WHENCE YOU CAME!”

[The force of her power extinguishes the Eye’s flames and sends Sauron hurtling into the sky. Galadriel’s powerful form disappears, and she staggers; Elrond catches her as she collapses. Sauron can be seen hurtling toward the horizon, presumably to land in Mordor. Gandalf and Radagast stop and look; Gandalf, holding his sword, is looking better.]

[Elrond:] “Dandollen hon.” [Subtitle: We were deceived.]

[Galadriel:] “The spirit of Sauron endured.”

[Saruman:] “And has been banished.”

[Galadriel:] “He will flee into the east.”

[Elrond:] “Gondor should be warned. The must set a watch on the walls of Mordor.”

[Saruman:] “No. Look after the Lady Galadriel. She has spent much of her power. Her strength is failing. Take her to Lothlórien.”

[Elrond:] “My Lord Saruman, he must be hunted down and destroyed, once and for all.”

[Saruman:] “Without the Ring of Power, Sauron can never again hold dominion over Middle-earth. Go now! Leave Sauron to me.”

[Saurman turns to face the direction in which Sauron was hurled, with a strange expression in his eyes.]



[Gandalf and Radagast arrive at Rhosgobel.

[Gandalf:] “I need a horse!”

[Radagast:] “What? Gandalf, where are you going?”

[Gandalf:] “To warn Erebor. They have no idea what is coming. I saw them with my own eyes - rank upon rank of Moria-orcs. You must summon our friends, bird and beast - the battle for the mountain is about to begin.”



[In Erebor, Thorin gazes upon the throne, over which the Arkenstone had been inlaid before it was lost. He speaks to Balin, Dwalin, and Bilbo, who are behind him.]

[Thorin:] “It is here in these halls - I know it.”

[Dwalin:] “We have searched and searched…”

[Thorin:] “Not well enough!”

[Dwalin:] “Thorin, we all would see the stone returned.”

[Thorin:] “And yet, it is still not FOUND!”

[Balin:] “Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here?”

[Thorin turns and slowly walks toward Balin and Dwalin.]

[Balin:] “The Arkenstone is the birthright of our people.”

[Thorin:] “It is the King’s Jewel.”

[He begins shouting.]

[Thorin:] “AM I NOT THE KING?!”

[As Thorin turns away, Balin, Dwalin, and Bilbo look uneasy.]

[Thorin:] “Know this - If anyone should find it and withhold it from me, I will be avenged.”

[As Thorin walks away, Bilbo looks very disgruntled.]



[Balin is in a quiet corner somewhere, breathing deeply as if he had just been weeping. Bilbo finds him.]

[Balin:] “Dragon-sickness - I’ve seen it before. That look. That terrible need. It is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo. It sent his grandfather mad.”

[Bilbo:] “Balin, if-if Thorin...had the Arkenstone...”

[Bilbo slightly cocks his head, and Balin looks surprised, understanding Bilbo’s implication.]

[Bilbo:] “...if it was found - Would it help?”

[Balin:] “That stone crowns all. It is the summit of this great wealth, bestowing power upon he who bears it. Will it stay his madness? No, lad; I fear it would make it worse. Perhaps it is best that it remains lost.” 

[Balin raises his eyebrows at Bilbo.]



[Bilbo is sitting on a bench in a hall. He reaches into his coat pocket and pulls something out. Thorin, walking in an adjoining hallway, sees the action.]

[Thorin:] “What is that?!”

[Thorin strides rapidly toward Bilbo, and Bilbo rises.]

[Thorin:] “In your hand!”

[Bilbo:] “It-It’s nothing.”

[Thorin:] “Show me.”

[Bilbo:] “It…”

[Bilbo holds out his hand, and in it is an acorn.]

[Bilbo:] “I picked it up in Beorn’s garden.”

[Thorin:] “You’ve carried it all this way.”

[Bilbo:] “I’m gonna plant it in my garden, in Bag End.”

[His anger fading, Thorin smiles fondly at Bilbo.]

[Thorin:] “That’s a poor price to take back to the Shire.”

[Bilbo:] “One day it’ill grow. And everytime I look at it, I’ll remember - Remember everything that happened, the good, the bad. And how lucky I am that I made it home.”

[They smile at each other. Bilbo prepares to speak.]

[Bilbo:] “Thorin, I...”

[Suddenly, Dwalin comes up and interrupts.]

[Dwalin:] “Thorin, survivors...from Laketown. They are streaming into Dale. There’s hundreds of them.”

[Thorin’s smile fades into a stern, uncompromising face.]

[Thorin:] “Call everyone to the gate.”

[Thorin strides off, shouting.]

[Thorin:] “TO THE GATE! NOW!”



[The Laketowners walk into the ruins of Dale. They stare around at the ruins, including many charred and burned bodies.

[Bard:] “Come on, keep moving.”

[Alfrid:] “SIRE! Sire! Up here” 

[Bard looks up to see Alfrid on one of the city walls. Bard joins him.]

[Alfrid:] “Look sire, the braziers are lit.”

[They see giant braziers full of fire at the gates of Erebor.]

[Bard:] “So, the company of Thorin Oakenshield survived.”

[Alfrid:] “Survived? You mean there’s a bunch of dwarves in there with all that gold?”

[Bard:] “You shouldn’t worry, Alfrid. There’s gold enough in that mountain for all.”

[Bard walks away and calls to the people.]

[Bard:] “Make camp here tonight. Find what shelter you can. Get some fires going. Alfrid, you take the night watch.”

[As Alfrid looks sourly at Bard and stomps off, Bard looks back at the Mountain, uneasy.]



[Within the walls of Erebor, the dwarves work to block up the entrance that Smaug broke through. They carry rocks both by hand and with the help of various pulleys and other machines.] 

[Thorin:] “I want this fortress made safe by sunup. This mountain was hard won - I will not see it taken again.”

[Kili:] “The people of Laketown have nothing. They came to us in need. They have lost everything.”

[Thorin:] “Do not tell me what they have lost. I know well enough their hardship. Those who have lived through dragonfire should rejoice. They have much to be grateful for.”

[Thorin looks out at the city of Dale, where many fires can be seen lit by the people. He then turns and shouts to his dwarves.]

[Thorin:] “More stone! BRING MORE STONE TO THE GATE!”

[Bilbo looks on in despair.]



[Gandalf rides his horse rapidly through a plain.



[It is night in Dale, and the people sit around, as the healthy tend to the wounded. Infants can be heard crying.]

[Man:] “These children are starving! We need food!”

[Man:] “We won’t last three days!”

[Percy:] “Bard, we don’t have enough.” 

[Bard:] “Do want you can, Percy”

[Woman:] “We need more water.”

[Bard:] “The children, the wounded and the women come first.”

[Bard walks over to where Alfrid had been standing guard. Alfrid was actually napping, and he wakes up as Bard speaks.]

[Bard:] “Morning, Alfrid. What news from the night watch?”

[Alfrid:] “All quiet, sire, I must report. Nothing gets past me.”

[Yawning, he gets up and follow Bard outside, only to find that Bard has stopped suddenly in the archway.]

[Bard:] “Except an army of elves, it would seem.”

[Outside, the courtyard is packed full of Mirkwood elves dressed in full battle gear, standing in perfectly ordered lines. The people of Laketown begin coming out of their buildings and see the elves. Bard walks down the steps and approaches the elves, some lines of which turn and step back to make a pathway for Bard. As he exits out the bank of elves, King Thranduil rides up on his steed, and all the elves turn to face him.]

[Bard:] “My lord Thranduil; we did not look to see you here.”

[Thranduil:] “I heard you needed aid.”

[Thranduil turns and looks at a wagon that is pulling up; it is loaded with food and drink for the people. The people of Laketown smile and cheer, and begin unloading the cart with the elves’ help. Bard approaches Thranduil gratefully.]

[Bard:] “You have saved us! I do not how to thank you.”

[Thranduil:] “Your gratitude is misplaced. I did not come on your behalf.”

[Thranduil’s voice is cold.]

[Thranduil:] “I came to reclaim something of mine.”

[Meanwhile, in the Mountain, Thorin picks up a beautiful necklace made of tiny, shining, and white gems. We hear Thranduil speaking in a flashback from the previous movie.]

[DIALOG-FLASHBACK - START]

[Thranduil:] “There are gems in the mountain that I too desire. White gems of pure starlight.

[DIALOG-FLASHBACK - END]

[Thorin:] “The white gems of Lasgalen.”

[Thorin:] “I know an Elf-Lord who would pay a pretty price for these.”

[Thorin tosses the necklace back into the pile of jewels, scattering many of the tiny gems.]

[Meanwhile, back in Dale, Thranduil watches his troops march out of Dale. Bard runs up to him.]



[Bard:] “Wait! Please, wait! You would go to war over a handful of gems?”

[Thranduil:] “The heirlooms of my people are not lightly forsaken.”

[Bard:] “We are allies in this. My people also have a claim upon the riches in that mountain! Let me speak with Thorin!”

[Thranduil:] “You would try to reason with a dwarf?”

[Bard:] “To avoid war? Yes!”



[In Erebor, Thorin strides toward the blocked off gate, calling th other dwarves to him.]

[Thorin:] “Come on!”

[The dwarves lay down their tools, pick up their weapons, and follow him up the stairs they’ve created in the blockage, all the way to a platform they have built at the top of the gate from which they have a vantage point over the plain in front of the gate. They see the walls of Dale filled with Elves ready for war. Bard rides up the path to the gate on a horse, and stops in front of the gate.]

[Bard:] “Hail Thorin, son of Thrain! We are glad to find you alive beyond hope.”

[Thorin:] “Why do come to the gates of the king under the mountain armed for war?”

[Bard:] “Why does the king under the mountain fence himself in? Like a robber in his hole.”

[Thorin:] “Perhaps it is because I am expecting to be robbed.”

[Bard:] “My lord - We have not come to rob you, but to seek fair settlement. Will you not speak with me?”

[Thorin nods, and steps away from the platform and down the stairs. Bard dismounts his horse and crosses the bridge in front of the gate. As he approaches the blockade, a raven flies out of the opening above the gate and wings away rapidly, cawing loudly. Bard sees a hole built into the blockade, and Thorin strides up to the other end of the hole.]

[Thorin:] “I’m listening.”

[Bard:] “On behalf of the people of Laketown, I ask that you honor your pledge. A share of the treasure so that they might rebuild their lives.”

[Thorin:] “I will not treat with any man while an armed host lies before my door.”

[Bard:] “That armed host will attack this mountain, if we do not come to terms.”

[Thorin:] “Your threats do not sway me.”

[Bard:] “What of your conscience? Does it not tell you our cause is just?! My people offered you help. And in return you brought upon them only ruin and death!”

[Thorin:] “When did the men of Laketown come to our aid, but for the promise of rich reward?!”

[Bard:] “A bargain was struck!”

[Thorin:] “A bargain? What choice did we have but to barter our birthright for blankets and food? To ransom our future in exchange for our freedom? You call that a fair trade? Tell me, Bard the Dragonslayer…”

[Bard looks up, surprised.]

[Thorin:] “...Why should I honor such terms?”

[Bard:] “Because you gave us your word. Does that mean nothing?”

[Thorin turns away from the hole, disappearing from Bard’s view. He leans back against the blockade and for a moment looks tired and weary. He then looks at the other dwarves and Bilbo, who are all standing there. He shouts back to Bard.]

[Thorin:] “Be gone, ere arrow fly!”

[Bard slaps the rock angrily, then mounts his horse and rides back to Dale. The company watches him go from the top of the platform.]

[Bilbo:] “What are you doing?! You cannot go to war.”

[Thorin:] “This does not concern you.”

[Bilbo:] “Excuse me?! But just in case you haven’t noticed, there is an army of elves out there. And not to mention several hundred angry fishermen. We-We are in fact outnumbered.”

[Thorin turns to look at Bilbo, smiling.]

[Thorin:] “Not for much longer.”

[Bilbo:] “What does that mean?”

[Thorin:] “It means Master Baggins, you should never underestimate dwarves.”

[Thorin turns to the whole group.]

[Thorin:] “We have reclaimed Erebor - Now we defend it!”

[As Thorin strides down the steps, Bilbo and Balin looks distressed.]



[Bard rides back to the gates of Dale, where Thranduil is waiting.]

[Bard:] “He will give us nothing.”

[Thranduil:] “Such a pity. Still, you tried.”

[Bard:] “I do not understand - Why? Why would he risk war?”

[They look back toward the Mountain in time to see the dwarves dislodge the head of one of the massive stone statues, causing it to fall and break the raised bridge to the gate, thus disabling any attackers from approaching the gates.]

[Thranduil:] “It is fruitless to reason with them; they understand only one thing.”

[Thranduil pulls out his sword and gazes at it.]

[Thranduil:] “We attack at dawn! Are you with us?”

[As Thranduil rides back toward the city, Bard looks over his shoulder at Erebor.]



[In Dale, Bard and the Lakepeople begin collecting and distributing the various weapons and armor stored there. In Erebor, the dwarves do the same, suiting up for battle. As Bilbo walks by, Thorin calls out to him, holding something.]

[Thorin:] “Master Baggins, come here!”

[Bilbo comes up and sees that Thorin is holding a tunic of white mail.]

[Thorin:] “You are going to need this. Put it on.”

[Bilbo begins removing his jacket.]

[Thorin:] “This vest is made of silver steel - “Mithril” it was called by my forebears.”

[Thorin holds it up so that Bilbo can slide into it.]

[Thorin:] “No blade can pierce it.”

[Bilbo finishes putting it on, then looks at himself; the other dwarves watch too.]

[Bilbo:] “I look absurd. I’m not a warrior; I’m a Hobbit.”

[Thorin:] “It is a gift. A token of our friendship. True friends are hard to come by.”

[Although he had started off smiling at Bilbo, he looks toward the other dwarves and frowns, then grabs Bilbo by the shoulder and pulls him away where the other dwarves can’t hear him.]

[Thorin:] “I have been blind. Now I begin to see. I am betrayed!”

[Bilbo:] “Betrayed?”

[Thorin:] “The Arkenstone.”

[As Thorin moves closer to him, Bilbo looks extremely uncomfortable and worried. Thorin whispers to Bilbo.]

[Thorin:] “One of them has taken it.”

[Bilbo almost sighs audibly in relief.]

[Thorin:] “One of them is false.”

[Bilbo:] “Thorin...the quest is fulfilled. You’ve won the mountain. Is that not enough?”

[Thorin:] “Betrayed by my own kin.”

[Bilbo:] “No eh...You...You made a promise...to the people of Laketown. Is-Is this treasure truly worth more than your honor? Our honor, Thorin. I was also there, I gave my word.”

[Thorin:] “For that I’m grateful. It was nobly done. But the treasure in this mountain does not belong to the people of Laketown! This gold...is ours...and ours alone. By my life I will not part with a single coin! Not...one...piece of it!”

[As Thorin speaks, his voice grows deeper and more and more like Smaug’s, until the very last line, which was exactly a repeat of what Smaug had said previously to Bilbo. Thorin is clearly mentally affected, and Bilbo stares at him in shock as the other dwarves, dressed for battle, stride by.]



[Legolas and Tauriel leave their horses and scramble up a rocky outcrop. They crouch behind some rocks at the top and see a fortress ahead.]

[Tauriel:] “Gundabad. What lies beyond?”

[Legolas:] “An old enemy - The ancient kingdom of Angmar. This fortress was once its stronghold. It is where they kept their great armories, forged their weapons of war.”

[A light flickers in a window of the fortress, then disappears.]

[Tauriel:] “A light! I saw movement.”

[Legolas:] “We wait for the cover of night. It is a fell place, Tauriel. In another age our people waged war on those lands.”

[Legolas pauses, looking pained. Tauriel looks at him.]

[Legolas:] “My mother died there. My father does not speak of it. There is no grave, no memory, nothing.”



[In Dale, the people are preparing for war, sharpening swords and collecting supplies. They jump out of the way as Gandalf gallops into town on his horse.]

[Gandalf:] “Let me through!”

[Gandalf:] “Make way!”

[Gandalf dismounts in the main courtyard and looks surprised to see men drilling with swords and companies of elves marching by. Alfrid comes up to him, upset.]

[Alfrid:] “No, No, NO! Oi! You - pointy hat!”

[Gandalf turns to look at him.]

[Alfrid:] “Yes, you. We don’t want no tramps, beggars nor vagabonds around here. We got enough trouble without the likes of you. Off you go! On your horse.”

[Gandalf:] “Who’s in charge here?!”

[Bard walks up.]

[Bard:] “Who is asking?”



[A little bit later, Gandalf is meeting with Bard and Thranduil in a tent.]

[Gandalf:] “You must set aside your petty grievances with the dwarves. War is coming! The cesspits of Dol Guldur have been emptied. You’re ALL in mortal danger!”

[Bard:] “What are you talking about?”

[Thranduil:] “I can see you know nothing of wizards. They are like winter thunder on a wild wind rolling in from a distance, breaking hard in alarm. But sometimes a storm is just a storm.”

[Gandalf:] “Not this time. Armies of orcs are on the move. And these are fighters! They have been bred for war. Our enemy has summoned his full strength.”

[Thranduil:] “Why show his hand now?”

[Gandalf:] “Because we forced him! We forced him when the company of Thorin Oakenshield set out to reclaim their homeland. The dwarves were never meant to reach Erebor; Azog the Defiler was sent to kill them. His master seeks control of the mountain. Not just for the treasure within, but for where it lies, its strategic position.”

[As Gandalf talks, they have left the tent and walked outside to a spot from where they can clearly see the gates of Erebor.]

[Gandalf:] “This is the gateway to reclaiming the lands of Angmar in the north. If that fell kingdom should rise again, Rivendell, Lothlorien, the Shire, even Gondor itself will fall!”

[Thranduil:] “These orc armies you speak of, Mithrandir - Where are they?”

[Gandalf is unable to answer.]



[Meanwhile, an Orc rides out of a tunnel on a Warg and approaches Azog, who is feeding his Warg at the entrance to the tunnel.]

[Orc:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Our army will be in position by dawn. The attack will be sudden and swift!]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: The fools! They have forgotten what lives beneath these lands.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: They have forgotten the great Earth-eaters.]

[As they ride away, we see the side of a hill covered in giant holes, each the entrance to a tunnel. A sound of the earth being drilled and crushed can be heard all around. The tunnels are pointing toward the Lonely Mountain in the distance.]



[Back at Gundobad, it is dark.]

[Tauriel:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: If we are going in - we should move now.]

[Suddenly, massive bats being screeching and flying around.]

[Tauriel:] “Dúilith secherig.” [Subtitle: They are swarming.]

[Legolas:] “These bats are bred for one purpose.”

[Tauriel:] “For what?”

[Legolas:] “For war.”

[As the bats swarm overhead, a figure rides out on a Warg. It is Bolg, dressed for battle. He raises his mace and shouts out a command; trumpets sound, and gates in the bottom of the fortress open, releasing rank upong rank of massive orcs, each with a giant spear at least three times longer than the orcs’ height.]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _”

[The massive company begins marching away, with the bats following and wheeling overhead.]

[Tauriel:] “Din methithar i phain.” [Subtitle: We must warn the others.]

[Legolas:] “Penim lû. Tolo!” [Subtitle: We may be too late - hurry!]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _”

[As Bolg yells out a command, the ranks of Orcs part to let smaller, lighter, and faster Orcs run ahead of their companions, snarling.]



[Back in Thranduil’s tent, Gandalf confronts Thranduil.]

[Gandalf:] “Since when has my council counted for so little? What do you think I’m trying to do?!”

[Thranduil:] “I think you’re trying to save your dwarvish friends. And I admire your loyalty to them, but it does not dissuade me from my course. You started this, Mithrandir. You will forgive me if I finish it.”

[Thranduil exits the tent and calls to one of the elves.]

[Thranduil:] “Are the archers in position?”

[Elf:] “Yes my Lord.”

[Thranduil:] “Give the order. If anything moves on that mountain - kill it!”

[Thranduil:] “The dwarves are out of time.”



[It is night; at the blocked off entrance to the gate, a rope is suddenly thrown over the edge. Bilbo clambers hand-over-hand down the rope, slipping along the way. He manages to climb across the moat using some of the rubble. He begins running toward Dale.]



[Gandalf approaches Bard.]

[Gandalf:] “You, Bowman! Do you agree with this? Is gold so important to you? Would you buy it with the blood of dwarves?!”

[As the speak, Bilbo sneaks past some of the Laketown guards.]

[Bard:] “It will not come to that. This is a fight they cannot win.”

[Suddenly, Bilbo appears and addresses both of them.]

[Bilbo:] “That won’t stop them. You think the dwarves will surrender - They won’t. They will fight to the death to defend their own.”

[Gandalf:] “Bilbo Baggins!”

[Bilbo smiles happily.]



[Back in Thranduil’s tent, Bilbo is presented before Thranduil.]

[Thranduil:] “If I’m not mistaken, this is the halfling who stole the keys to my dungeons from under the nose of my guards.”

[Bilbo looks extremely uncomfortable.]

[Bilbo:] “Yes. Sorry about that.”

[There is a silence for a while, then Bilbo steps forward and puts a wrapped package on the table.]

[Bilbo:] “I came...to give you this.”

[He unwraps the package to reveal the Arkenstone. Thranduil rises in surprise.]

[Thranduil:] “The heart of the mountain! The King’s Jewel.”

[Gandalf and Bard approach to look at it in awe.]

[Bard:] “And worth a king’s ransom. How is this yours to give?”

[Bilbo:] “I took it as my fourteenth share of the treasure.”

[Gandalf smiles slightly.]

[Bard:] “Why would you do this? You owe us no loyalty.”

[Bilbo:] “I’m not doing it for you. I know that dwarves can be obstinate and pigheaded and difficult, suspicious and secretive…with the worst manners you can possibly imagine, but they also brave and kind...and loyal to a fault. I’ve grown very fond of them, and I would save them if I can.”

[Bilbo:] “Thorin values this stone above all else. In exchange for its return, I believe he will give you what you are owed. There will be no need for war!”

[Gandalf, Bard, and Thranduil look at each other.]



[Gandalf leads through Dale.]

[Gandalf:] “Rest up tonight. You must leave on tomorrow.”

[Bilbo:] “What?”

[Gandalf:] “Get as far away from here as possible.”

[Bilbo:] “I’m-I’m not leaving. You picked me as the fourteenth man. I’m not about to leave the company now.”

[Gandalf:] “There is no company - not any more. And I don’t like to think what Thorin will do when he finds out what you’ve done.”

[Bilbo:] “I’m not afraid of Thorin.”

[Gandalf:] “But you should be! Don’t underestimate the evil of gold. Gold over which a serpent has long brooded. Dragon-sickness seeps into the hearts of all who come near this mountain.”

[Gandalf looks at Bilbo appraisingly.]

[Gandalf:] “Almost all.”

[Gandalf sees Alfrid walking by and calls out to him.]

[Gandalf:] “You there! Find this Hobbit a bed, and fill his belly with hot food. He has earned it.”

[Alfrid grudgingly comes over and begins to lead Bilbo away. As they go, Gandalf grabs Alfrid’s arm and whispers to him.]

[Gandalf:] “Hey. Keep an eye on him. If he should try to leave, you will tell me.”

[Alfrid walks off, cursing as a group of people walk in front of him and he pushes his way between them.]

[Alfrid:] “Move it! Stupid...”



[Early the next morning, we see that the plain in front of the Mountain is covered in legions of Elves and men, armed for battle. The dwarves, also prepared, watch from above the gate blockade.]



[Alfrid comes to wake Bilbo up, carrying a bowl of food.]

[Alfrid:] “Wakey, Wakey, Hobbit. Up you...get.”

[He pauses as he realizes that Bilbo is not in the room where he had left him.]



[Thranduil and Bard ride together to the front of the armies and approach their side of the broken bridge over the moat. From above the blockade, Thorin draws a bow and shoots an arrow at the ground directly in front of Thranduil and Bard, who immediately halt in surprise.]

[Thorin:] “I will put the next one between your eyes!”

[Thorin draws his bow again, and the dwarves on the wall cheer and shake their weapons. Thranduil stares at Thorin angrily, then slightly tilts his head. Instantly, several rows of Elves near the front of the army pull out their bows, nock their arrows, and aim at the dwarves, all in one fluid motion. The dwarves’ cheering cuts off abruptly as all of them but Thorin duck behind the ramparts. After holding the pose for a few seconds, Thranduil raises his hand, and the elves easily put away their arrows. Thorin still has his bow drawn, though.]

[Thranduil:] “We’ve come to tell you: payment of your debt has been offered...and accepted.” 

[Thorin:] “What payment? I gave you nothing! You have nothing!”

[Bard:] “We have this.”

[Bard reaches into his robe and pulls out the Arkenstone, holding it above his head. Thorin, shocked, lowers his bow.]

[Kili:] “They have the Arkenstone? Thieves! How came you by the heirloom of our house? That stone belongs to the king!”

[Bard:] “And the king may have it - in our good will.”

[Bard puts the Arkenstone back into his robe.]

[Bard:] “But first he must honor his word.”

[Thorin whispers to himself, and the dwarves near him can hear.]

[Thorin:] “They are taking us for fools. This is a ruse, a filthy lie.”

[Balin looks shocked that Thorin’s mental state has deteriorated to the point at which he would even consider this. Thorin then yells out.]

[Thorin:] “THE ARKENSTONE IS IN THIS MOUNTAIN! IT IS A TRICK!”

[At the top of the ramparts, Bilbo steps out from the dwarves.]

[Bilbo:] “It-It’s no trick. The stone is real. I gave it to them.”

[As Bilbo speaks, Thorin’s expression changes to a mixture of sorrow and anger. Thranduil and Bard look worries, as they thought Bilbo was still safely in Dale. Thorin and the other dwarves look at Bilbo in shock.]

[Thorin:] “You…”

[Bilbo:] “I took it as my fourteenth share.”

[Thorin:] “You would steall from me?”

[Bilbo:] “Steal from you? No. No. I may be a burglar, but I like to think I’m an honest one. I’m willing to let it stand against my claim.”

[Thorin:] “Against your claim?! Your claim! You have no claim over me you miserable rat!”

[Thorin throws down his bow in anger and begins walking toward Bilbo.]

[Bilbo:] “I was going to give it to you. Many times I wanted to, but...”

[Thorin:] “But what, thief?!”

[Bilbo:] “You are changed, Thorin! The dwarf I met in Bag End would never have gone back on his word! Would never have doubted the loyalty of his kin!”

[Thorin:] “Do not speak to me...of loyalty!”

[Thorin shouts to the other dwarves.]

[Thorin:] “Throw him from the rampart!”

[Bilbo looks shocked. The other dwarves, rather than obeying Thorin, step away from Bilbo in confusion. Thranduil and Bard look concerned. Thorin is surprised that no one obeyed him.]

[Thorin:] “DO YOU HEAR ME?!”

[Thorin grabs Fili’s arm, but Fili shakes him away.]

[Thorin:] “I will do it myself!”

[He lunges forward and grabs Bilbo, shouting.]

[Thorin:] “CURSE YOU!”

[Fili:] “No!”

[As Thorin struggles with Bilbo, the other dwarves leap forward, shouting, to pull Thorin away. Thorin manages to grab Bilbo and begins pushing him over the rampart.]

[Thorin:] “Cursed be the Wizard that forced you on this Company!”

[Suddenly, Gandalf appears, striding through the armies. His voice is magically amplified to incredibly loud, deep, and powerful tones.]

[Gandalf:] “IF YOU DON’T LIKE MY BURGLAR…”

[His voice returns to a normal volume and tone.]

[Gandalf:] “Then please don’t damage him. Return him to me! You’re not making a very splendid figure as king under the mountain, are you? Thorin son of Thrain!”

[Thorin slowly lets Bilbo up, and some of the other dwarves rush to help Bilbo up.]

[Thorin:] “Never again will I have dealings with wizards...”

[Bofur gently pushes Bilbo toward the rope he’d hung the night before to climb down the walls.]

[Bofur:] “Go.”

[Thorin:] “Or Shire-rats!”

[Bilbo throws his coiled rope over the wall and clambers down.]

[Bard:] “Are we resolved? The return of the Arkenstone for what was promised.”

[Thorin, breathing heavily, looks to a ridge in the distance, as if looking for someone or something.]

[Bard:] “Give us your answer! Will you have peace or war?”

[As Thorin bows his head, a large raven flies up to the ramparts and perches beside him. Thorin and the raven stare at each other.]

[Thorin:] “I will have war!”

[A rumbling is heard in the distance, and the armies look up to see the ridge being covered by troops of heavily armored dwarves, lead by a huge dwarf riding a battle-pig.]

[Gandalf:] “Ironfoot.”

[The Erebor dwarves begin cheering and screaming as they see their backup arriving.]

[Thranduil:] “Ribo i thangail!” [not translated onscreen: Rush the shield-fence!]

[Thranduil rides through his army as his Elves and the Lakepeople turn away from the gates of Erebor and begin marching quickly toward the oncoming Iron Hills dwarves. Gandalf strides along with them, Bilbo rushing to keep up.]

[Bilbo:] “Who is that? He doesn’t look very happy.”

[Gandalf:] “It is Dain, lord of the Iron Hills - Thorin’s cousin.”

[Bilbo:] “Are they alike?”

[Gandalf:] “I always found Thorin the more reasonable of the two.”

[The two armies halt a short distance from one another, and Dain rides his pig onto a rocky overlook to address the Elves and Men.]

[Dain:] “Good morning! How are we all? I have a wee proposition, if you wouldn’t mind giving me a few moments of your time. Would you consider...just sodding off!”

[The townspeople, clutching their weapons, step back in fear, while the Elves pull out their swords and step forward.]

[Dain:] “All of you - right now!”

[Bard:] “Stand fest!”

[Gandalf strides forward.]

[Gandalf:] “Come now, lord Dain!”

[Dain:] “Gandalf the Grey. Tell this rabble to leave, or I’ll water the ground with their blood!”

[Gandalf:] “There is no need for war between dwarves, men and elves! A legion of orcs march on the mountain. Stand your army down!”

[Dain:] “I will not stand down before any elf! Not least this faithless woodland sprite!”

[He gestures toward Thranduil, who looks angry.]

[Dain:] “He wishes nothing but ill upon my people! If he chooses to stand between me and my kin - I’ll split his pretty head open! See if he’s still smirking then!”

[Thranduil smiles furiously, and the Erebor dwarves cheer.]

[Thranduil:] “He’s clearly mad, like his cousin!”

[Dain:] “You hear that, lads?!”

[He turns and rejoins his army.]

[Dain:] “Come on! Let’s give these ***** a good hammering!”

[Iron Hills Dwarf:] “_ _ _”

[A dwarf yells out a command, and the Iron Hills dwarves raise their weapons and cheer. The Elves perform a complicated maneuver to put their shield-and-spear bearers at the front of the army, while the arches stand behind them. As both armies prepare to fight, a rumbling is heard at the base of a spur of the mountain. The armies grow silent as they turn to look. Gandalf whispers to himself.]

[Gandalf:] “Were-worms!”

[At the spur of the mountain where the rumbling is coming from, massive worms, hundreds of feet long and dozens of feet thick, break through the rocks. Their mouths are essentially giant drilling machines, strong enough to crush the toughest rocks in their jaws. The human, Elf, and dwarf armies look on in shock.]

[Dain:] “Oh, come on!”

[The worms suddenly retreat into the tunnels they’d made through the mountains approaching the Lonely Mountain. As the mist clears, we see Azog and a few other Orcs standing atop a hill. Behind them are several massive contraptions made of wood, rope, and cloth, meant as signalling devices. 

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Come forth my Armies!]

[As Azog gives a sign, one of the wooden structures opens up in a particular position, and a horn sounds. Immediately, legions of Orcs begin pouring out of the were-worm tunnels.]

[Dain:] “The hordes of hell are upon us! To battle! To battle, sons of Durin!”

[Dain and part of his army turn and rush toward the oncoming Orcs.]

[Fili:] “I’m going over the wall! Who’s coming with me?”

[The other dwarves cheer and agree, preparing to climb down.]

[Thorin:] “Stand down!”

[Dwarf:] “What?”

[Fili:] “Are we to do nothing?”

[Thorin:] “I said STAND DOWN!”

[As Thorin walks away, the other look on in shock and surprise. Meanwhile, as Dain and a company of his dwarves rush toward the oncoming Orcs, the Elves stay right where they are. The dwarves are clearly outnumbered by the Orcs.]

[Bilbo:] “The elves, will they not fight?”

[Gandalf:] “Thranduil! This is madness!”

[Thranduil looks back at the Iron Hills dwarves, who have stopped and built a shield wall with their massive spears pointed outward, lead by the chants of the leader. The orcs are fast approaching the shield wall. Suddenly, right as the Orcs reach the dwarves, the Elves leap up over the shield wall from behind, wielding their swords, and begin raining down blows on the Orcs. As the Elves press forward, the dwarvish shield wall is raised and the dwarves rush forward, cutting down Orcs with their spears. Dain rides furiously through the Orcs, smashing them left and right with his hammer.]

[As the remaining elves march toward the battle, Gandalf and Bilbo are standing in one place.]

[Bilbo:] “Eh, Gandalf - Is this a good place to stand?”

[At the top of the hill, Azog commands his Orcs.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Send in the War Beasts!]

[The wooden signalling devices change their position to show a new signal. Gandalf, seeing the signal, looks toward the tunnels to see new legions of Orcs, including massive trolls and other monsters, come out. Thranduil shouts to his troops.]

[Thranduil:] “_ _ _” 

[The Elves stop and pull out their bows.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: They cannot fight on two fronts. Now we make our move.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Attack the city!]

[As a horn sound and the signalling device changes again, another legion of Orcs that had been waiting for the signal turn and march toward Dale, which is between the current battle and the tunnels.]

[Gandalf:] “Azog - he’s trying to cut us off”

[They see massive trolls, each large enough to carry multiple other dwarves and wooden structures such as catapults on their back, march toward the city along with the armies of Orcs.]

[Bard:] “All of you, fall back to Dale! Now!”

[Bard, the Lakepeople, Gandalf, and Bilbo rush toward the city, trying to intercept the Orcs.]

[Gandalf:] “To the city! Bilbo! This way!”

[The monstrous trolls approaching the city stop at a rise overlooking Dale. They bend over and plant all four legs on the ground, thus making their backs horizontal. On their backs are catapults loaded with large rocks; orcs on the trolls’ backs wind up the gears of the catapults. At a signal from their leader orc, who strikes the ground with his mace, the catapults are released, and the rocks fly toward Dale. They smash into the walls and towers, destroying everything they hit. As Bard, at the front of his army, rides across a bridge into Dale, we see the Orc army approaching the wall from another area. A troll with a giant triangle-shaped rock strapped to his head runs up to the wall and smashes into it headfirst, knocking it down and knocking himself out in the some motion. The orcs behind him rush into the city through the hole, entering the houses and killing whatever people they find.] 



[In the city, the screaming townspeople flee from the oncoming orcs. Sigrid and Tilda hide in a building as they see a troll climb over the wall. Meanwhile, Bain, holding a sword, looks for them among the fleeing people.]

[Bain:] “Sigrid! Tilda!”



[Bard rides into the city and dismounts, drawing his sword. He runs against the flow of the fleeing people, looking for his children.]

[Bard:] “My children! Where are my children?”

[Woman:] “I saw them. They were down in the old market.”

[Bard:] “The market?! Where are they now? Tilda! Sigrid!”

[Percy runs up at the head of a company of the Laketown soldiers.]

[Percy:] “Bard, Orcs are storming over the causeway!”

[Bard:] “Get the bowmen to the eastern parapet. Hold them off for as long as you can!”

[Percy:] “Archers, this way!”

[Fleeing Man:] “The orcs have taken Stone Street! The market’s overrun!”

[Bard:] “The rest of you, follow me!”

[Bard’s group encounters the orcs, and they begin fighting. Elsewhere in Dale, Gandalf and Bilbo are also fighting the orcs. A group of townspeople run toward the orcs, and Alfrid is running with them.]

[Alfrid:] “Charge! Onward! To the death!”

[While still shouting, he stops running, panting for breath. Seeing that no one is watching him, he hides in a building.]

[Orcs are chasing Sigrid and Tilda. As they run screaming around a corner, Bain jumps out and kills the lead orc. The second orcs knocks him to the ground and swings at him, only to get his sword caught on something overhead. Bain uses this chance to thrust his sword into the orc, killing it. He and his sisters round a corner and see their father fighting further up the lane, uphill from them.]

[Sigrid:] “DA!”

[Tilda:] “Da! We’re down here!”

[Bain:] “Here!”

[Bard hears them and turns to see them, looking relieved. However, his expressions changes to shock when he sees a troll enter the lane behind the children, throwing men many feet away with a single blow of his mace. The troll sees the children and growls, and the girls scream. They are too far away for Bard to reach them in time, and he looks around frantically. As the troll approaches the children, Bard tilts upright a cart that had been laying sideways in the courtyard. He scrambles into it and launches it down the avenue toward the children. The troll raises its mace to smash the children, but pauses in surprise when it sees Bard hurtling toward it in the cart.]

[Bard:] “BAIN, SIGRID - GET DOWN!”

[They throw themselves to the floor as the cart bounces over them. It then smashes into the troll and sends it flying; Bard is also thrown forward, and he manages to thrust his sword into the troll’s heart in a flying strike.]



[We see an overhead shot of both battlefields: the plains in front of Erebor, and the battle in Dale. Bard and his children run up an empty street.]

[Bard:] “Listen - I need you to gather the women and children. Take them to the Great Hall and barricade the door.”

[Alfrid, hiding in a doorway nearby, hears them speaking. Bard gently takes Bain’s sword from him.]

[Bard:] “You understand - you must not come out for any reason!”

[Tilda:] “We wanna stay with you!”

[Alfrid steps out.]

[Alfrid:] “Show your father some respect!”

[Alfrid:] “You leave it to me, sire. You heard him, we make to the Great Hall!”

[Alfrid grabs Tilda and Sigrid and begins rushing them away. Bard calls after him.]

[Bard:] “Alfrid, women and children only. I need every man fighting. See that you return!”

[He thrusts the sword into Alfrid’s hands.]

[Alfrid:] “I’ll get them to safety, sire.”

[Seeing orcs appear nearby, he nervously hurries away.]

[Alfrid:] “And my sword is yours to command.”

[He begins rounding up the people he sees.]

[Alfrid:] “Get up!”

[Bard holds Bain’s face earnestly.]

[Bard:] “Look after them!”

[Alfrid:] “Shift it, granny!”

[As Bain catches up to Alfrid, Alfrid rudely tosses him the sword, and Bain looks at him in disgust.]

[Bard and his men continue fighting orcs.]

[Bain and the other help the weak and elderly.]

[Bain:] “Make for the Great Hall!”

[As they approach the Great Hall, Alfrid runs and pushes his way through the people, knocking many of them over in his haste to reach the doors.]

[Alfrid:] “Out of my way! Abandon the cripples!”



[As more and more orcs and trolls enter the city, Thranduil rides his elk into the city by crossing one of the bridges. As he crosses, his elk tramples many orcs. The elk lowers its horns and spears five orcs at the same time, lifting them up so that Thranduil can behead all of them with one swing of his sword. As they thunder into the city, the elk is killed by multiple Orc arrows to the chest. As it falls, Thranduil leaps clear and rolls. He comes up from his roll to find himself surrounded by orcs. He pulls out both his sword and begins fighting them, soon reinforced by his elven foot troops.]

[In the city, the men, elves, and orc all fight each other, and the orcs seems to have the upper hand because of their massive numbers. Azog watches from his hilltop vantage point.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: They cannot hold the city. The Dwarves are almost spent.]

[In the plains in front of Erebor, the Iron Hills dwarves are being driven back by the orcs. Orcs manage to kill Dain’s war pig.]

[Dain:] “You buggars!”

[He begins killing orcs left and right with his hammer and by headbutting them.]

[Dain:] “Where’s Thorin?! We need him! Where is he?”

[From his vantage point, Azog gloats as both battlefronts are being won by the orcs.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Let these lands run with blood! Slaughter them all.]

[Bard:] “FALL BACK!”



[Meanwhile, in Erebor, Thorin is merely sitting on the throne. Dwalin approaches him.]

[Dwalin:] “Since when do we forsake our own people? Thorin, they are dying out there.”

[Thorin:] “There are halls beneath halls within this mountain - places we can fortify.”

[Dwalin looks disappointed and angry.]

[Thorin:] “Shore up, make safe. Yes…”

[Thorin:] “...Yes - that is it. We must move the gold further underground - to safety!”

[Thorin begins walking away, but Dwalin angrily calls out to him.]

[Dwalin:] “Did you not hear me?! Dain is surrounded! They’re being slaughtered, Thorin.”

[Thorin:] “Many die in war. Life is cheap. But a treasure such as this cannot be counted in lives lost. It is worth all the blood we can spend!”

[Dwalin:] “You sit here in these vast halls, with a crown upon your head, and yet you are lesser now than you have ever been.”

[Thorin:] “Do not speak to me as if I was some lowly dwarf lord…”

[As he speaks, Thorin is clearly mentally affected.]

[Thorin:] “As-As if I were still...Thorin...Oakenshield.”

[Thorin:] “I AM YOUR KING!”

[Thorin roars and pulls out his sword; however, he is so unbalanced that he almost falls over.]

[Dwalin:] “You were always my king. You used to know that once.”

[Dwalin bows his head in sorrow.]

[Dwalin:] “You cannot see that you have become.”

[Thorin:] “Go! Get out...before I kill you.”

[After looking at each other for a while, Dwalin turns and leaves.]



[Thorin walks through the hall in which he tried to drown Smaug; the entire floor is covered in gold a few feet deep. In his head, he hears many of the words that he spoke or were spoken to him earlier.]

DIALOG-FLASHBACK - START

[Dwalin:] “You sit here...with a crown upon your head...you are lesser now than you have ever been...”

[Thorin:] “...but a treasure such as this cannot be counted in lives lost...”

[Balin:] “...a sickness lies upon that treasure...”

[Bard:] “...the blind ambition of a mountain-king…”

[Thorin:] “...AM I NOT THE KING...”

[Thorin:] “...this gold...is ours...and ours alone...” 

[Balin:] “...treasure…”

[Thorin:] “...I will not part with a single coin...”

[Bard:] “...he could not see beyond his own desire...”

[Thorin:] “...as if I was some lowly dwarf lord…”

[Thorin:] “...Oakenshield...”

[Balin:] “...a sickness that drove your grandfather mad...”

[Thorin:] “...Oakenshield...”

[Dwalin:] “...this is Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror...”

[Thorin:] “...I am not my grandfather…my grandfather.”

[Gandalf:] “...you are the heir to the throne of Durin...”

[Dwalin:] “...they are dying out there.”

[Gandalf:] “...take back...take Erebor...”

[Dwalin:] “...Dain is surrounded... surrounded...is surrounded...Dain is surrounded...”

[Gandalf:] “...take back your homeland…”

[Bilbo:] “...you are changed, Thorin...”

[Thorin:] “...I am not my grandfather…”

[Bilbo:] “...is this treasure truly worth more than your honor...”

[Thorin:] “...I am not my grandfather…”

[The voices suddenly stop, and Thorin looks down and sees the shadowy shape of Smaug sliding beneath the gold {he is imagining things}.]

[Gandalf:] “...this treasure will be your death…”

DIALOG-FLASHBACK - END

[Thorin screams as the gold beneath him turns into a sinkhole and he begins drowning, surrounded by gold. He screams as he tries to escape, but keeps getting pulled down. As he disappears beneath the gold, his imagination/dream ends. He is standing in the golden court. He yanks off his crown and throws it to the floor. He has finally comes back to his senses.]



[Meanwhile, the battle is going badly.]

[Dain:] “FALL BACK! FALL BACK! TO THE BARRICADE! FALL BACK!”

[The remaining dwarves begins retreating toward the gates of Erebor, with the orcs in pursuit.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Now comes their end. Prepare for the final assault.]

[A signal horn sounds, the the orcs regroup to march on the dwarves.]



[Just inside the gates of Erebor, the dwarves of the Company sit desolately, hearing the cries of battle outside but unable to help their kin. They rise as they see Thorin approaching from further in the mountain, sword drawn. He is no longer dressed in his royal robes and arbor, but in a simple leather outfit. Kili rises and begins shouting.]

[Kili:] “I will not hide behind a wall of stone, while others fight our battles for us!”

[Thorin and Kili continue to approach each other.]

[Kili:] “It is not in my blood, Thorin.”

[They stop in front of each other.]

[Thorin:] “No, it is not. We are sons of Durin. And Durin’s folk do not flee from a fight.”

[Thorin lays his hand on Kili’s shoulder, smiling. Kili smiles back at him through his tears. They touch foreheads. Thorin turns to the rest of the dwarves.]

[Thorin:] “I have no right to ask this of any of you; but will you follow me one last time?”

[The dwarves rise and raise their weapons, ready to follow their leader and friend again.]



[Dain and his surviving dwarves set up a desparate shield wall in front of the moat by Erebor’s gates; the orcs line up by rank, ready to attack them. Azog suddenly stops the orcs with him on the hill from signalling the attack.]
 
[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Not yet! Wait...wait]

[Several heavily armored trolls shoulder their way to the front of the Orc ranks.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Attack...now!]

[The orcs sound their signalling horn, and the orcs and trolls begin to march forward. Suddenly, another trumpet is heard; it is Bombur, atop the wall. The orcs stop in confusion. In Dale, Bilbo and Gandalf hear the sound too and look up in surprise.]

[Bilbo:] “Thorin!”

[The barricade of rocks in the gateway of Erebor suddenly smashes outward as it is hit from inside by a giant golden statue that the dwarves had hung up like a bell. The rocks fall forward and make a rough bridge across the moat. Thorin and his dwarves rush out and through the ranks of the Iron Hills dwarves; Azog looks on in shock. Dain begins shouting to his troops.]

[Dain:] “TO THE KING! TO THE KING!”

[Thorin:] “Du Bekâr!” [not translated onscreen: To arms!]”

[Thorin leads the way as all the dwarves form a wedge behind him. They smash their way through the orc ranks, releasing their pent up anger and hatred.]

[In Dale, Bilbo and Gandalf look out at the plain from an abandoned causeway.]

[Bilbo:] “The dwarves! They’re rallying!”

[They watch as the dwarves, fighting with new vigour, destroy the orcs.

[Gandalf:] “They are rallying to their king!”



[Bard speaks to his remaining men.]

[Bard:] “Any men who want to give their last - follow me!”

[They charge through the city and clash with the orcs, fighting with reckless abandon now that they know the dwarves are back at it.]



[In the Great Hall, The Woman grabs a spear and speaks to the others huddled inside.]

[The Woman:] “I say we stand with our men in life and in death! Arm yourselves!”

[Many of the women and older men grab their weapons and follow her; Bain grabs his sword. Meanwhile, a woman speaks to an old lady sitting hunched over under her shawl.]

[Woman #2:] “Come with us, love.”

[Alfrid:] “No, no, no! You leave an old woman be.”

[Woman #2:] “Don’t be afraid.”

[The “woman” under the shawl suddenly stops using the fake voice and speaks in a male voice; it is actually Alfrid, who was trying to disguise himself as an old lady.”

[Alfrid:] “I said get off!”

[The Woman reaches over the yanks off the shawl, revealing Alfrid to everyone.]

[The Woman:] “Alfrid Lickspill, you are a coward!”

[Alfrid:] “Coward?! Not every man is brave enough to wear a corsett!”

[Woman #1:] “You’re not a man, you’re a weasel!”

[As the others grab whatever tools or weapons they can find to join the battle, an urn falls over, and Alfrid sees it fall. It breaks open to reveal that is was full of gold and silver coins.]



[On the battlefield, Thorin defeats an orc. He calls out to Dain, who is not far away.]

[Thorin:] “Dain!”

[Dain:] “Thorin!”

[Dain:] “Hold on! I’m coming!”

[They continue killing orcs, all the while getting closer to each other.]

[Dain:] “Hey cousin, what took you so long?!”

[In a brief respite, they are able to meet and hug.]

[Dain:] “There’s too many of these buggars, Thorin. I hope you’ve got a plan.”

[Thorin looks up and sees the hilltop on which Azog’s wooden machines and signalling orders.]

[Thorin:] “Aye - We’re going to take out their leader!”

[Dain:] “Azog...”

[Thorin strides forward and mounts a large goat that Dain’s army had brought.]

[Thorin:] “I’m gonna kill that piece of filth!”

[Thorin, Dwalin, Fili, and Kili, each on a goat, charge toward Azog’s hill, smashing through the Orc armies in their way.]

[Dwalin:] “Lead on!”



[Back in Dale, Gandalf watches human spearmen and archers kill a massive troll.]

[Gandalf:] “We may yet survive this.”

[Bilbo:] “GANDALF!”

[Gandalf kills an orc, then hurries over to where Bilbo is standing at the wall and watching Thorin, Dwalin, Fili, and Kili ride up a spur of the mountain to where Azog is.]

[Bilbo:] “It’s Thorin!”

[Gandalf:] “And Fili, Kili...and Dwalin. He’s taking his best warriors!”
 
[Bilbo:] “To do what?”

[Gandalf:] “To cut the head off the snake.”

[Atop the hill, Azog hears the sound of goat hooves, and he snarls. Thorin and Co. reach some ruins on top of the hill, killing orcs along the way; there is a frozen river between them and where Azog is. ]



[Legolas and Tauriel arrive back in Dale together on a horse; they charge through the streets, killing orcs on their way. They come to where Gandalf is standing.]

[Legolas:] “Gandalf!”

[Gandalf:] “Legolas... Legolas Greenleaf!”

[Legolas:] “There is a second army! Bolg leads a force of Gundabad orcs. They are almost upon us!”

[Gandalf:] “Gundabad…This was their plan all along. Azog engages our forces, then Bolg seeps in from the north.”

[Bilbo:] “Wha...the north...where is the north, exactly?!”

[Gandalf:] “Ravenhill.”

[Gandalf turns and strides over to the parapets to look at the hill where Thorin went; that is Ravenhill.]

[Bilbo:] “Ravenhill…Thorin is up there! And Fili and Kili - they’re all up there!”

[At the sound of Kili’s name, Tauriel is alarmed. Together, they all look out toward the top of Ravenhill, which is shrouded in mist.]



[Thorin and Co. are still fighting in the ruins across the frozen river from Azog’s stronghold. Having defeated all the enemies at present, they look out across the river at the ruins in which Azog was last seen; his wooden signalling machines are visible through the mist.]

[Thorin:] “Where is he?”

[Kili:] “Looks empty. I think Azog has fled!”

[Thorin:] “I don’t think so...Fili, take your brother. Scout out the towers. Keep low and out of sight. If you see something; report back, do not engage - do you understand?!”

[Dwalin:] “We have company; Goblin mercenaries. No more than a hundred.”

[They look back the way they came to see goblins running over the ruins toward them.]

[Thorin:] “We’ll take care of them. Go! Go!”

[Dwalin:] “Come on!”

[As Fili and Kili run towards the river, Thorin and Dwalin prepare to meet the goblins rushing toward them.]



[In a moment of peace, Thranduil walks slowly through the city, seeing the fallen bodies on the ground, many of which are his own elves. His commander comes running up.]

[Thranduil:] “Recall your company.”

[The commander blows a horn. Gandalf comes running up.]

[Gandalf:] “My lord, dispatch this force to Ravenhill! The dwarves are about to be overrun. Thorin must be warned.”

[Thranduil:] “By all means, warn him. I have spent enough Elvish blood in defense of this accursed land - No more!”

[Thranduil walks away haughtily and angrily.]

[Gandalf:] “Thranduil?!”

[Bilbo:] “I’ll go!”

[Gandalf:] “Don’t be ridiculous! You’ll never make it!”

[Bilbo:] “Why not?”

[Gandalf:] “Cause they will see you coming and kill you!”

[Bilbo:] “No, they won’t.”

[Gandalf looks at Bilbo peculiarly.]

[Bilbo:] “They won’t see me.”

[Gandalf:] “It’s out of the question - I won’t allow it!”

[Bilbo:] “I’m not asking you to allow it, Gandalf.”

[Gandalf says nothing; they nod to each other, then Bilbo strides away. Turning a corner, he presses into an alcove and pulls out his ring. He looks at it for a few moments, then puts it on. Invisibly, he runs through the city, seeing the remaining battles. In his ring-enhanced vision, the elves appear to be beings of white light, while the orcs are like solid shadows.]



[As Thranduil and his elves march through the city, killing orcs, they stop abruptly as they see Tauriel standing in the middle of the lane ahead of them, looking resolute.]

[Tauriel:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: You will go no further.]

[Tauriel:] “ You will not turn away - not this time!”

[Thranduil:] “Get out of my way!”

[Tauriel:] “The dwarves will be slaughtered!”

[Thranduil:] “Yes, they will die. Today, tomorrow, one year hence, a hundred years from now - what does it matter? They are mortal.”

[Thranduil has slowly been approaching Tauriel as he speaks. Suddenly, Tauriel whips out her bow and nocks an arrow, pointing it at Thranduil.]

[Tauriel:] “You think your life is worth more than theirs, while there is no love in it? There is no love in you!”

[Thranduil looks at her angrily for a moment; suddenly, he whips out his sword and slices Tauriel’s bow in half. As she drops it in shock, Thranduil lifts the point of his sword to her neck and speaks angrily.]

[Thranduil:] “What do you know of love?! Nothing! What you feel for that dwarf is not real! You think it is love?! Are you ready to die for it?”

[Suddenly, another sword, Orcrist, is laid atop Thranduil’s. It is Legolas. He pushes Thranduil’s sword away.]

[Legolas:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: If you harm her, you will have to kill me.]

[As Thranduil stares at him in shock and anger, Thranduil turns to Tauriel.]

[Legolas:] “I will go with you.”

[They hurry away together.]



[Alfrid, still wearing a woman’s outfit and clutching the gold he found to his chest, weaves through the city, dodging orcs. As he backs toward a wall, an orc climbs over it and roars at him. It raises its club to kill him, and he screams. Suddenly, from behind him, Bard shoots and arrow and kills the orc. Alfrid falls over, and money falls out of his dress, and he tries to gather it up]

[Bard:] “Get up!”

[Alfrid:] “Get away from me! I don’t take orders from you! People trusted you. They listened to you. The master’s mantle was there for the taking. And you threw it all away - for what?”

[Bard turns and looks back. Alfrid follows his gaze to see Bard’s children in a doorway, staring at him as his dress is full of coins. He turns and stomps away.]

[Bard:] “Alfrid - your slip is showing.”

[Alfrid adjusts his dress, then rushes away.]



[Invisibly, Bilbo is hurrying across bridges toward Ravenhill.]

[Fili and Kili creep quietly through the ruins below Azog’s signalling station. They hear a noise.]
 
[Fili:] “Stay here. Search the lower levels. I’ve got this.”



[Having defeated the goblins, Thorin looks anxiously out over the frozen river.]

[Dwalin:] “Where is that orc filth?”

[Bilbo appears out of thin air behind him, panting.]

[Bilbo:] “Thorin…”

[Thorin:] “Bilbo!”

[Bilbo:] “You have to leave here! Now! Azog has another army attacking from the north. This watchtower will be completely surrounded. There’ll be no way out.”

[Dwalin:] “We are so close! That orc scum is in there. I say we push on.”

[Thorin:] “No! That’s what he wants. He wants to draw us in.”

[Suddenly, Thorin appears to have understood something alarming.]

[Thorin:] “This is a trap!”



[In the ruins, Fili hears a sound in front of him and turns around, only to see lights coming up the hallway from behind him too; he is trapped.]



[Thorin talks to Dwalin.]

[Thorin:] “Find Fili and Kili! Call them back!”

[Dwalin:] “Thorin, are you sure about this?”

[Thorin:] “Do it. We live to fight another day.”

[As they turn to leave, they hear a drum sound from Ravenhill. Looking back at the tower, they see a light appear. Atop the tower, Azog appears, dragging a bloodied Fili behind him.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: This one dies first.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Then the brother.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Then you, Oakenshield.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: You will die last.]

[Fili:] “No! RUN!”

[Thorin, Dwalin, and Bilbo look on in shock as Azog lifts Fili by the neck, then stabs him through the chest with his arm-blade.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Here ends your filthy bloodline!]

[Azog drops Fili, who falls to the ground from the tower, lifeless. He falls past Kili, who has been watching from a doorway below. Kili, seeing his dead brother on the ground, furiously rushes up the tower steps toward Azog.]

[Thorin:] “KILI!”

[Thorin begins running across the frozen river.]

[Dwalin:] “Thorin!”

[Dwalin:] “Thorin...No.”

[Kili rushes up the steps, killing orcs in his way. As Thorin begins to clamber up the ruins, Azog rushes out of a tunnel and attacks him. They fight on the snowy mountainside, Thorin with his sword and Azog with his arm-blade and a mace.]

[Bilbo, still on the other side of the river, hears a noise and ducks as werebats fly out of the fog. His sword glows blue, and he looks back to see Bolg and his forces climbing over the ruins. Seeing Bilbo, the orcs charge at him. Just before they reach him, Dwalin charges up and begins fighting the orcs singlehandedly.]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _” 

[Bolg:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Slay them all!]

[Tauriel and Legolas pause on their way to Ravenhill as they see the Werebats massing.]

[Tauriel:] “No…”

[The werebats fly down to the main battlefields, swooping through ranks of soldiers and causing mayhem. Legolas leaps and grabs the leg of a passing Werebat, and it carries him away. Tauriel sees Kili fighting several orcs on the ruins.]

[Tauriel:] “Kili...”

[Azog and Thorin continue fighting. Thorin manages to knock Azog down, and Azog slides down a slippery slope; before Thorin can chase after him, other orcs arrive and he is forced to fight them. In the courtyard, Bilbo throws rocks at orcs as Dwalin fights. Kili continue fighting his way up the ruins. Tauriel, looking for him, encounters and kills several orcs. Meanwhile, the werebat is still carrying Legolas in the air.]

[As Bilbo continues throwing rocks, Bolg suddenly runs out and smacks Bilbo in the head with the handle of his mace, knocking him out cold. As the werebat carries Legolas over a stone tower, he shoots it through the neck, killing it and forcing it to release him; he drops gracefully on top of the tower. Azog, recovered suddenly charges at Thorin and knocks him onto the surface of the frozen river.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Go in for the kill!]

[Azog yells to his orcs, many of which run out on to the ice to attack Thorin.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Finish him!]

[Thorin looks around rapidly as many orcs run toward him; suddenly, the orcs begin falling over with arrows stuck in them. Legolas is shooting the orcs attacking Thorin from the top of the tower. Thorin, with his broken sword, takes on the remaining orcs.]

[Tauriel, in a moment of peace after dispatching her opponent, calls out.]

[Tauriel:] “KILI!”

[Kili hears her, but he’s too busy fighting two orcs at once to respond.] 

[Tauriel:] “KILI!”

[Kili:] “TAURIEL!”

[Tauriel:] “Kili…”

[Suddenly, Bolg jumps out of a tunnel and kicks Tauriel into a rock.]

[Tauriel:] “NO!”

[Seeing this, Kili angrily defeats his opponents and begins making his way toward her. Tauriel manages to slip out from Bolg’s grasp and begins attacking him with her knife; he manages to grab both her arms and twists them, causing her to shriek in pain; he then smashes his fist down on her head, felling her. Thorin continues fighting orcs while Legolas helps. Kili rushes desperately as he hears Tauriel’s groans. Bolg raises Tauriel up by the throat; she manages to kick him in the knee, causing him to fall. He grabs her and throws her bodily against a wall. As she lays stunned on the ground, he raises his mace for the kill; suddenly, Kili leaps from a parapet onto him. They fight, and Kili manages to slash him, but Bolg grabs Kili by the head and raises the pointed base of his mace to stab him through the chest. Tauriel shout and jumps on Bolg from behind.]

[Tauriel:] “No!”

[Bolg manages to throw her down again, and she can do nothing as Bolg raises his mace and plunges it through Kili’s chest.]

[Tauriel:] “No!”

[As Kili dies, he and Tauriel stare into each others eyes; both of them are tearing up. Bolg drops Kili to the ground dead. Tauriel’s grief turns to anger, and she leaps onto Bolg as he approaches her. They are standing over the edge of a precipice, and Bolg tries to swing her out over the fall. She manages to hold on to him and kick off a stone, launching them both over the edge.]

[Legolas, on top of the tower, suddenly feels the tower shaking. He looks down to see a troll smashing away at the tower’s base. Hearing Tauriel’s grunts, he looks out and sees her rolling with Bolg down the mountainside. She lands on a broken staircase, gasping in pain. Meanwhile, Bolg has landed near her; he rises and prepares to kill her. Legolas, seeing this, reaches back for an arrow, only to find that he has run out. He angrily throws down his bow and pulls out Orcrist. He leaps off the top of the tower and plummets down holding his sword out; he manages to stab the troll in the head, and it hobbles around in pain. Twisting the sword, he manages to get the troll to charge forward, smashing head first into the already-weakened base of the tower. Bolg looks up to see the tower fall over and make a bridge over the chasm in between Legolas and Bolg. As Tauriel lays unconscious, Bolg and Legolas charge at each other over the makeshift bridge. They begin fighting. As they fight, Bolg swings his heavy mace at Legolas and misses, hitting the floor and causing it to crumble and fall into the chasm.]

[Meanwhile, Thorin manages to stab an orc in the knee; another orc rushes up and smashes into him, causing him to slide across the ice all the way to the edge of the waterfall, directly over Legolas and Bolg. Bolg knocks Legolas over, but as he raises his mace, Thorin manages to knock an orc over the edge of the waterfall; it lands on the bridge behind Bolg, breaking through the stones and causing him to fall under a pile of rubble. Another orc approaches Thorin, who is lying on his back, partially hanging over the edge of the waterfall, defenseless. As it raises its sword, Legolas manages to throw Orcrist into the orc’s chest, killing it. As it falls over the edge, Thorin manages to reach out and grab the sword, saving it from going over.]

[As Legolas is watching Thorin, Bolg leaps out of the rubble and swings at Legolas, but Legolas dodges and pulls out his two knives, fighting Bolg with them. Thorin stands and looks in wonder at his blade come back to him; he looks up and sees Azog, alone, facing him. Thorin and Azog approach each other slowly; suddenly, a horn blows, and Azog smiles as a hill in the distance behind him becomes covered with approaching orc help. Azog charges forward and swings a large rock attached to a chain at Thorin, who ducks under it. As Azog is unbalanced by the swing, Thorin manages to get behind him and slash him. Azog angrily swings the rock at him again, and as Thorin dodges, the rock smashes into the ice, cracking it.]

[Meanwhile, Bolg throws a huge stone at Legolas, and it smashes the bridge beneath him. In an amazing and inhuman feat of agility, Legolas manages to run up falling rocks and leaps at Bolg. As they fight, Legolas manages to stab at Bolg, but Bolg grabs the knife between his arm and armor, just like in their encounter in Laketown. This time, though, Legolas smiles and uses the knife as leverage to swing atop Bolg’s shoulder; he then stabs Bolg through the top of the head, killing him; Legolas leaps back onto land as the bridge falls to the ground, carrying Bolg’s body with it. Legolas looks for Tauriel, but doesn’t see her.] 

[Legolas:] “Tauriel!”

[As Thorin and Azog fight, the ice continues cracking. They both pause for a second, then Azog swings again. This time, the ice actually begins to break apart beneath them. As Thorin stumbles over an edge of the ice, Azog manages to knock his legs out from under him with the chain. As Azog swings again, Thorin manages to roll away. He leaps behind Azog, who is off balance, and slashes him again. Azog angrily swings the rock and chain at Thorin, missing; this time, the rock becomes stuck in the ice, and Azog is forced to slash at Thorin with his bladed arm. Suddenly, Azog looks into the sky behind Thorin in shock; we see the Eagles, with Radagast riding their leader, swoop by. They sail through the ranks of the oncoming orc reinforcements from Gundabad, decimating them. Beorn, riding atop one of the Eagles, throws himself off it and transforms into a bear as he falls to the ground, landing in full massive bear form right in the middle of the orcs. He smashes through them.]

[Meanwhile, Thorin suddenly throws his sword down. Reaching forward, he lifts the rock at the end of the chain and tosses it to Azog, who instinctively catches it. Azog looks at him in shock. Thorin jumps backward, off the ice floe that they were both standing on; without his weight to balance it, and with Azog at the other end holding the rock, the ice floe tips over and plunges Azog into the water below. He scrabbles at the edge, but the chain pulls him down. Thorin pants in exhaustion.]

[The Eagles attack the werebats, ripping them out of the air. As Thorin bends down to pick up Orcrist, he sees Azog through the ice, being pulled slowly by the current toward the frozen waterfall. Thorin slowly walks above him, and they stare at each other through the ice. Azog closes his eyes. Suddenly, he opens them, and he manages to stab Thorin through the foot, through the ice, with his blade arm. He leaps through the ice and pins Thorin down. As he stabs his blade arm at Thorin, Thorin manages to stop it from piercing his chest by sliding Orcrist in one of the forks of the blade. Azog, using gravity and his superior weight and position, slowly pushes his blade further and further, and Thorin struggles to keep it away. As they stare at each other, Thorin suddenly slides his sword out of the fork, allowing Azog’s blade to stab him through the chest. As Azog smiles, Thorin raises his own sword and stabs Azog through the heart; from their close quarters, Azog cannot avoid it. Thorin flips Azog over onto his back on the ice and forces Orcrist all the way through Azog and through the ice below. Azog dies, with Thorin kneeling on top of him. Thorin, mortally wounded, struggles to get up.]

[Bilbo, waking up from unconsciousness, sees the Eagles overhead.]

[Bilbo:] “The eagles are coming…”

[Thorin stumbles toward the edge of the frozen waterfall, looking out over the battlefield below, where the remaining orcs are being routed. Weak from his wound, he collapses on his back. Bilbo comes running up in surprise.]

[Thorin:] “Bilbo…”

[Bilbo:] “Don’t move! Don’t move! Lie still!

[Bilbo examines Thorin’s wound, then recoils in shock.]

[Bilbo:] “Oh!

[Thorin:] “I’m glad you’re here…

[Bilbo:] “Shh.”

[Thorin:] “I wish to part from you in friendship.”

[Bilbo:] “No. You are not going anywhere, Thorin. You’re going to live.”

[Thorin:] “I would take back my words and my deeds at the gate. You did what only a true friend would do. Forgive me...I was too  blind to see. I’m so sorry that I have led you into such peril.”

[Thorin begins choking up blood.]

[Bilbo:] “No, no, I’m glad to have shared in all your perils,Thorin - each and every one of them. And it’s far more than any Baggins deserve.”

[They smile at each other.]

[Thorin:] “Farewell, Master Burglar. Go back to your books and your armchair. Plant your trees - watch them grow.”

[Thorin struggles to choke.]

[Thorin:] “If more people valued home above gold this world would be a merrier place.”

[Thorin gasps deeply, then begins to expire.]

[Bilbo:] “No! No! No! No! No! No! Thorin! Oh don’t you dare!”

[Thorin breathes out his last and dies.]

[Bilbo:] “Thorin, Thorin, wake up. The eagles...the eagles...the eagles are here. Thorin...the eag…”

[Bilbo cries in sorrow.]



[Tauriel, heartbroken, places Kili’s stone in his dead hand, as Legolas watches.]



[Thranduil walks slowly through the ruins of Ravenhill, gazing about at the carnage. Legolas approaches him.]

[Legolas:] “I...cannot go back.”

[Legolas brushes past his father and prepares to leave.]

[Thranduil:] “Where will you go?”

[Legolas turns and faces Thranduil.] 

[Legolas:] “I do not know.”

[Thranduil:] “Go north. Find the Dúnedain. There’s a young Ranger amongst them- you should meet him. His father, Arathorn, was a good man. His son might grow to be a great one.”

[Legolas:] “What is his name?”

[Thranduil:] “He’s known in the wild as Strider. His true name you must discover for yourself.”

[They nod at each other, then Legolas turns and walks away. Thranduil calls after him, and Legolas pauses.]

[Thranduil:] “Legolas... your mother loved you...more than anyone...more than life.”

[Legolas opens his eyes open in shock and surprise. Legolas and Thranduil make a gesture of departure to each other, then Legolas leaves. Thranduil watches him leave sadly, bowing his head in grief. He then proceeds through the ruins and finds Tauriel still next to Kili’s body.]

[Tauriel:] “They want to bury him.”

[Thranduil:] “Yes…”

[Tauriel:] “If this is love, I do not want it.”

[Heartbrokenly, Tauriel pleads with Thranduil.]

[Tauriel:] “Take it from me, please! Why does it hurt so much?”

[Thranduil approaches her slowly with an understanding look in his eyes.]

[Thranduil:] “Because it was real.”

[Tauriel looks up at him in shock. After thinking for a while, she kisses Kili one last time.]



[Bilbo is sitting by himself and staring off into the distance; Gandalf comes to join him. They sit there, quietly, thinking. Gandalf begins cleaning out his pipe quite noisily, and Bilbo looks like he’s about to object. After a moment’s pause, they nod at each other.]

[The remaining members of Thorin’s company kneel beside the body of their King, paying him homage. Bilbo and Gandalf, sitting, watch.]

[In Dale, Percy blows on a huge horn, and all the townspeople, who are gathered along the walls, stare out reverently at Erebor; this is presumably during Thorin’s funeral.]



[Bilbo and Balin walk out of the gates of Erebor; Bilbo is wearing his pack and is prepared to leave. Balin tries to persuade him to stay.]

[Balin:] “There is to be a great feast tonight. Songs will be song, tales will be told and Thorin Oakenshield will pass into legend.”

[Bilbo:] “I know that’s how you must honor him, but to me he was never that - he was...to me...he was…”

[Bilbo is unable to find the words, and Balin smiles fondly at him.]

[Bilbo:] “Well, I think I’ll slip quietly away. Will you tell we others I said goodbye?”

[Balin:] “You can tell’ em yourself.”

[Bilbo looks back and smiles as he sees the other dwarves standing behind him. He speaks to all of them.]

[Bilbo:] “If any of you ever passing Bag End, tea is at four - there’s plenty of it. You are welcome anytime.”

[The dwarves bow to him, and he smiles. He begins to turn away, then turns back.]

[Bilbo:] “Eh, don’t bother knocking.”

[The dwarves chuckle, some of them wiping away tears. Bilbo, after waving goodbye, walks toward Gandalf, who is waiting with his horse and a pony for Bilbo.]

[They ride slowly back toward the Shire, admiring the scenery as they go.]



[They dismount at the edge of the Shire, and Bilbo begins to walk with all his things in his arms.]

[Gandalf:] “Ah, the borders of the Shire. It is here I must leave you.”

[Bilbo:] “That’s a shame. I quite liked having a wizard around. Seems they bring good luck.”

[Gandalf:] “You don’t really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck?”

[Gandalf looks knowingly at Bilbo.]

[Gandalf:] “Magic rings should not be used lightly, Bilbo.”

[Bilbo begins to protest, but Gandalf interrupts him.]

[Gandalf:] “Don’t take me for a fool - I know you found one in the Goblin tunnels...and I’ve kept my eye on you ever since.”

[Now that the secret is out, Bilbo smiles.]

[Bilbo:] “Well, thank goodness.”

[Bilbo:] “Farewell, Gandalf.”

[They clasp hands and look each other in the eye.]

[Gandalf:] “Farewell.”

[Bilbo turns and walks away; after a few paces, he stops and turns.]

[Bilbo:] “You, uh...you needn’t worry about that ring. It fell out of my pocket during the battle. I lost it.”

[Gandalf:] “You’re a very fine person, Mister Baggins. And I’m very fond of you. But you’re only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all.” 

[Bilbo continues walking back to the Shire, and Gandalf goes back the way he came.]



[As Bilbo climbs over the last hill before Hobbiton, he sees a lot of activity near Bag End, across the valley. As he walks up the path toward his house, he sees many hobbits passing in the opposite direction as him carrying various articles of furniture and other household articles.]
 
[Bilbo:] “Wait a minute...that’s my mother’s glory box. And that’s...my dining chair.”

[He sees a hobbit carrying a pouf (ottoman) on his shoulder.]

[Bilbo:] “Ah! Put that pouf down! What is going on?!”

[A hobbit with a wheelbarrow full of things stops to greet him cheerfully.]

[Hobbit:] “Hello, Mister Bilbo!” 

[Suddenly, he realizes who he is talking to and looks surprised.]

[Hobbit:] “...You’re not supposed to be here.”

[Bilbo:] “What do you mean?”

[Hobbit:] “On account of you being presumed dead and all.”

[Bilbo:] “I am not dead! Presumed or otherwise!”

[Bilbo turns and hurries up the hill toward Bag End, passing more and more hobbits carrying his things.]

[Hobbit:] “I’m not sure that’s permitted, Mister Bilbo!”

[In front of Bag End, and auctioneer is auctioning off Bilbo’s things. A sign reads: “For sale, by auction. The effects and estate of the late Mr. Bilbo Baggins, esq. 10 o’clock sharp, June the 22nd. Messrs Grubb, Grubb and Burrowes. Registered Auctioneers.]

[Auctioneer:]  “Twenty-one! Haha! Sold to Mrs Bolger! Somewhere for Fatty to put his feet on, haha!”

[Auctioneer:]  “Do I have any bids for this? This is Shire-made. None of your dwarvish reproductions here.”

[Auctioneer:] “Our next bid…”

[Bilbo, running up, interrupts him.]

[Bilbo:] “Stop! Stop! There’s been a mistake!”

[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins:] “Who are you?”  

[Bilbo:] “What do you mean who am I?! - You know bloody well who I am, Lobelia Sackville-Baggins! This is my home! And those are my spoons. Thank you very much!”

[Bilbo takes back some spoons that Lobelia had just bought at the auction.]

[Auctioneer:]  “This is most irregular. Excuse me, it’s been more than thirteen months since the disappearance. If you are, in fact, Bilbo Baggins and undeceased - can you prove it?”

[Bilbo:] “What?!”

[Auctioneer:]  “Oh, well, something official with your name on it would suffice.”

[Bilbo is, justifiably, quite flustered.]

[Bilbo:] “Alright! Right.”

[He pulls out the contract that he’d signed to join Thorin’s company and looks through it.]

[Bilbo:] “A contract...of employment as a...a...nevermind as what.”

[He shows it to the auctioneer.]

[Bilbo:] “There! My signature!”

[Auctioneer:]  “Uh, certainly seems to be in order. Yes, seems there can be no doubt.”

[As the auctioneer is reading, Bilbo mounts the steps to his house.]

[Auctioneer:]  “Who is this person you pledged your service to?”

[Bilbo pauses at the door.]

[Auctioneer:]  “...Thorin Oakenshield.”

[Bilbo looks sad.]

[Bilbo:] “He- he was my friend.”

[Opening the door, Bilbo walks in to find his house a mess, with items strewn all across the floor. As he walks about, he finds a handkerchief with his initials, BB, on it. He looks up and smiles. Finding a picture of his mother on the floor, he puts it back up on the wall next to the picture of his father; he straightens it out. He steps back and looks at it. As he inspects his handiwork, he puts his hands in his waistcoat pocket, but then pulls them out quickly when he feels his ring. He hesitates to put his hand back in his pocket, going back and forth. Eventually, he pulls it out and looks at it.]



[We see the hand holding the ring; it is now much older. We see that it is the present time, and Bilbo is quite old. A knock sounds at the door, and Bilbo clutches the ring tightly. He yells out.]

[Bilbo:] “No, thank you! We don’t want any more visitors, well-wishers or distant relations!”

[The voice of Gandalf is heard from outside.]

[Gandalf:] “And what about very old friends?!”

[Bilbo smiles broadly and hurries to open the door. We hear him and Gandalf talking in the background as the camera pans to one of Bilbo’s maps of Middle Earth, eventually centering on the Lonely Mountain.]

[Bilbo:] “Gandalf?!”

[Gandalf:] “Bilbo Baggins.”

[Bilbo:] “My dear Gandalf!”

[Gandalf:] “Good to see you. One hundred eleven years old - who’d believe it?" 

[Bilbo:] “Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome!”
